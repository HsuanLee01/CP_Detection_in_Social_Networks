8614.4;LMP; Okay. You should be able to see down into the portion of the IU right now, Joe. [Pause.];CAPCOM
8625.4;CAPCOM; Fred, Houston. We'd like to try going to Average on the TV for a minute or so.;LMP
8633.4;LMP; Okay. You've got Average, and a little yellow dust cap just floated by in front of us.;CAPCOM
8640.4;CAPCOM; Yeah. We see it at the top of the screen.;LMP
8645.4;CAPCOM; And, Fred, after a few minutes of this, at your convenience, we could use some interior shots if you get the time and if the lighting is good.;LMP
8655.4;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
8656.4;CAPCOM;And, 13, Houston. The S-IVB vent times are nominal as in the Flight Plan within a few seconds. [Long pause.];LMP
8682.4;CDR; We're hard docked, Houston.;CAPCOM

8746.4;CDR; And, Houston, Fred will handle the camera as we go through the postdocking checklist.;CAPCOM
8750.4;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. Real good.;LMP
8822.4;LMP; Okay, Joe. I am pointing it over toward Jack, and it's pretty bright with the Earth out that window. Is that sort of washing out the picture here?;CAPCOM
8833.4;CAPCOM; No, Fred, it's not. We've got a bright spot where the window is. The rest of you are semi-silhouetted. It's a pretty impressive picture. [Long pause.];LMP
8880.4;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston.;CMP
8882.4;CMP; Go ahead, Joe.;CAPCOM

8984.4;CAPCOM; Fred, this is Houston. Over.;CMP
8986.4;LMP; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
8988.4;CAPCOM; Okay. With the direct sunlight from the window, out of the TV camera field as it is now, we'd like you to open it up an f-stop or so and, if convenient, try to keep that bright spot out of the window.;LMP
9004.4;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
9098.4;CAPCOM;13, Houston. I guess we think we could stand one more click down on the f-stop.;LMP
9108.4;CMP; Okay, Joe. He's going to do it.;CAPCOM
9110.4;CAPCOM; That is, we want you to open it up. Looks like a very interesting book you're reading.;CMP
9117.4;CMP; I've got two of them.;CAPCOM

9149.2;LMP; Okay. I hope you got more detail than I have on the monitor here.;CAPCOM
9153.2;CAPCOM; No. We probably don't, but it's kind of a neat picture anyway. [Long pause.];LMP
9171.2;CMP; Houston, we're now going to finish repressurizing the tunnel.;CAPCOM
9178.2;CAPCOM;" Houston; Roger.";CMP
9239.2;LMP; [garbled] probably hear, Joe, we're just finishing pumping up Aquarius here.;CAPCOM
9246.2;CAPCOM; Okay. About all we see on this picture, Fred, are the bright spots with the lights around the tunnel area. The hatch itself is pretty dark.;LMP
9309.2;CAPCOM;13, Houston. By the way, we'd like to know how the High Gain Antenna lockup worked. Our signal strength is a little bit lower than we thought it would be.;CMP
9318.2;CMP; It looked just the way I expected it to, Joe. I had her sitting there in Reacq with the numbers cranked in and soon as we got pretty much through the rotation, I just threw it down to High Gain and it appeared to lock right up.;CAPCOM
9336.2;CAPCOM; Okay. Good deal. See that flashlight beam wandering around there.;LMP
9477.2;LMP;Houston, 13.;CAPCOM
9479.2;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Go ahead.;LMP
9525.8;LMP; We'd kind of like to hold off on the - start the venting again until we get the things pumped back up inside here. Wonder if you might give us a call to remind us when to initiate that.;CAPCOM
9541.8;CAPCOM;"Okay, 13; will do. [Long pause.]";LMP
9561.8;LMP; And we'll try to shift her up to look up into the tunnel here.;CAPCOM
9566.8;CAPCOM; Okay. Real good. [Long pause.];LMP
9589.8;CAPCOM;"Okay, 13; Houston. I think we could use an f-stop lower. What f-stop are you in now?";LMP
9598.8;LMP;I'm about as low as you can go, Joe. I'm sitting on 4.4.;CAPCOM
9601.8;CAPCOM; Okay. [Pause.];LMP
9613.8;LMP; What you're looking at, Joe, is the commander has removed the hatch and is proceeding to stow it. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
9661.8;CAPCOM;Okay, 13. That's a pretty good picture there.;LMP
9669.8;LMP; The CDR is verifying the docking latches now.;CAPCOM

9680.8;CMP; Hey, Joe. Jim reports that there's a slight, you know, burn smell up in the tunnel area, as been reported on previous flights.;CAPCOM
9689.8;CAPCOM; Okay. We copy that. [Long pause.];CMP
9721.8;CMP; Okay. The commander reports all docking latches latched.;CAPCOM
9726.8;CAPCOM;" Houston; Roger.";CMP
9738.2;CAPCOM;13, Houston. For your information, the S-IVB vent is proceeding on schedule.;CMP
9745.2;CMP; Okay, Joe.;CAPCOM
9750.2;LMP; Yeah, Joe. That's - That's concurring with all the thousands of particles I see going by outside here.;CAPCOM
9760.2;CAPCOM; Yes. I guess I didn't need to tell you.;LMP
9866.2;CAPCOM;13. Looks like Jim is connecting the umbilical at this time. Is that right?;LMP
9871.2;LMP; Yeah, that's affirm - affirm, Joe. Do you have any detail up in there at all? On the monitor it looks like I can - I can make out the drogue - the drogue a little bit, but not much else.;CAPCOM
9884.2;CAPCOM; We can see the probe pretty well, and we can see his hands quite well there.;CMP
9969.2;CMP; Okay. We're powering the LM now, Joe.;CAPCOM
9973.2;CAPCOM; Okay, Roger that. [Long pause.];CMP
9989.2;CAPCOM;And the voltage looks good there, 13.;CMP
9993.2;CMP; Roger. [Long pause.];LMP
10034.2;LMP; Okay. We're going to take an outside view now, out the left side, Joe.;CMP
10037.2;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. Real good. [Long pause.];LMP
10093.2;LMP; Okay. You making out the picture up there, Joe?;CAPCOM
10097.2;CAPCOM; Yeah. Is that the world? [Pause.];LMP
10109.2;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. That's a pretty nice looking picture. We'd like to know what settings you used to get that.;LMP
10118.2;LMP;Okay. I think Jim's holding it now and - it - Okay, it should be in about f:22, infinity, and I think the 50-millimeter. And Jim says he thinks he has Baja in the picture now.;CAPCOM
10140.2;CAPCOM;Okay. I think we could stand to go to f:44 on that. The clouds are pretty bright.;LMP
10146.2;LMP; Okay. We're going to have to press on here, Joe, so we're back inside.;CAPCOM
10150.2;CAPCOM; Okay. Thanks a lot.;LMP
10160.8;LMP; Okay. How's that picture looking back outside now, Joe? Getting ready for LM extraction.;CAPCOM

10230.8;CDR;Houston, this is 13. Do we have a Go for pyro arm?;CAPCOM
10236.8;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Affirmative. You're Go for pyro arm. [Long pause.];CDR
10266.8;CMP; Hey, Joe, when we went back up and rechecked the tunnel there, we found two latches that weren't cocked and we reset them.;CAPCOM
10278.8;CAPCOM; Ah, Roger that, Jack. [Long pause.];CMP
10332.8;CMP;Joe, I've got a beautiful view of the Earth out window 1.;CAPCOM

10550.2;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston.;CDR
10557.2;CDR; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
10558.2;CAPCOM; Okay. We'll be waiting for you to tell us that you feel you're safely clear of the booster, and give us the Go to command the booster in its yaw maneuver.;CDR
10664.2;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Did you - did you copy my last about giving us a Go for the yaw?;LMP
10671.2;LMP; Yeah, we're maneuvering, Joe, and we hadn't picked her back up again yet.;CAPCOM
10680.2;CAPCOM; Okay. Do you want to wait till you acquire it before we yaw it?;CDR
10688.2;CDR; How much time do you have, Houston? Can you wait, or do you want to do it right now?;CAPCOM
10694.2;CAPCOM; We can wait if you want us to, Jim. [Pause.];CDR
10696.2;CDR; Why don't you wait just a little bit.;CAPCOM
10698.2;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];CMP
10747.2;CMP; Joe, did they ever get an idea of what that - the TD and E fuel was?;CAPCOM
10754.2;CAPCOM; Jack, they're not willing to pin it down to a specific number right now because they say the tanks will warm up later on and the apparent consumption will go down. But it was nominal.;CMP
10765.2;CMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
10891.2;CMP; Okay, Houston. We have the S-IVB in sight. You're Go to maneuver the S-IVB.;CAPCOM
10896.2;CAPCOM; Houston, Roger that. [Long pause.];CMP
10929.2;CMP;We'll try to give you a - Houston, we're going to try to give you a shot of the S-IVB with the TV out window number 3.;CAPCOM
10936.2;CAPCOM; Okay. Real good, Jack. Our S-band signal strength has been fluctuating. Does it seem to be going all right up there in the Auto Track mode ?;CMP
10949.2;LMP;"Yeah. Right now; yes, it's dropped off to about the 70-percent point, Joe, and it was before up about 85.";CAPCOM
10959.2;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];LMP
10979.2;CDR; And, Houston, do you have a TV picture?;CAPCOM
10982.2;CAPCOM; Not at the moment, Jim. We had a garbled one there for a few seconds, and we don't have one at this moment.;CDR
10990.2;CDR; Okay. I can see the S-IVB now out the hatch window and it's...;CAPCOM
10996.2;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. Suddenly we have a very good picture.;CDR
10998.2;CDR; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
11035.2;CDR; And, Houston, I can see the gold shroud around the IU, and it looks that it's all intact.;CAPCOM
11041.2;CAPCOM;Roger, Jim. We copy that. Incidentally, the APS evasive maneuver will be about 4 minutes late. It'll be at about 04 plus 18.;CDR
11054.2;CDR; Roger. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
11082.2;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Wonder if you could zoom in on that S-IVB for us a little bit?;CDR
11087.2;CDR; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
11124.2;CAPCOM; Yeah, yeah. More like that. [Pause.] That's nice. [Pause.] It's off our screen to the right, now. [Long pause.];CDR
11173.2;CAPCOM; Oh, that's very nice, very nice. [Long pause.];CMP
11220.2;CMP;Okay, Joe. Is EECOM monitoring the O<sub>2</sub> Flow High light again? We - we haven't yet started the venting yet.;CAPCOM
11229.2;CAPCOM; Okay. Stand by. I'll check. [Long pause.];CMP
11260.2;CAPCOM;13, Houston.;CMP
11263.2;CMP; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
11264.2;CAPCOM; Jack, your cabin Regs are still making up, but you're Go to open the waste management vent again at this time, and we'll delta the time to close it by the appropriate amount for you.;CMP
11277.2;CMP; Okay. Real fine. Well, we'll wait till the S-IVB does its maneuver here.;CAPCOM
11283.2;CAPCOM; Okay.;LMP
11398.2;LMP; Okay, Joe. We just had a momentary drop off in signal strength again there.;CAPCOM
11404.2;CAPCOM; Roger, Fred. We had an LOS for a minute and we lost our TV picture. It looks like - yeah, we just got it back. It looks great again.;LMP
11420.2;CAPCOM;13, Houston. You might stop the f-stop down one more notch, if you got any left. [Long pause.];CMP
11446.2;CAPCOM;And, 13, Houston. We'll be commanding the evasive maneuver in about 17 seconds. [Long pause.];CMP
11506.2;CMP; Okay, Joe. We can see it start to move. However, it doesn't seem to be a lot of debris or vapor coming out of it.;CAPCOM
11513.2;CAPCOM; Roger that, Jack. Booster says that's great. He says the booster's doing its thing normally. Concur. We don't see much on the television at all. [Long pause.];CMP
11541.2;CAPCOM;And, Apollo 13, Houston. We'd like to change the S-band antenna configuration. Like you to go Omni Delta. Like you to go Manual mode on the High Gain with pitch of minus 60 and yaw of 90. Over.;CMP
11562.2;LMP;Okay. You want us to Omni Delta and Manual on the High Gain to minus 60 and plus 90. Is that correct?;CAPCOM
11569.2;CAPCOM; That's affirmative. [Long pause.];LMP
11591.2;CMP; Okay, Houston. How much longer would you like the television?;CAPCOM
11595.2;CAPCOM; Stand by on that. We'll get a word.;CMP
11606.2;CAPCOM;"Okay, 13; this is Houston. You can turn the TV off anytime you're ready. We've enjoyed the show. [Long pause.]";CMP
11625.2;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Before you secure the TV, we'd like to know whether that was in maximum zoom, just for information.;LMP
11633.2;LMP; That's affirm. Jim had it in Max zoom.;CAPCOM
11636.2;CAPCOM; Okay. Good deal. That was a real good picture. [Long pause.];LMP
11669.2;CAPCOM;And, 13, Houston. The APS evasive maneuver appeared to be nominal. The LOX dump time is now 4 plus 39 plus 20, about 3 minutes late.;CDR
11682.2;CDR; Roger.;CAPCOM
11849.2;CMP; Okay, Joe. We're right now opening the Waste Stowage Vent.;CAPCOM
11854.2;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. We copy. [Long pause.];CMP
11885.2;CMP; Okay, Houston. We're charging battery B.;CAPCOM
11890.2;CAPCOM;Roger, 13. We see it. Looks good.;CMP
12232.2;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston. Request Omni Alpha now. Over.;CDR
12342.2;CDR;Apollo 13, Houston.;CAPCOM
12345.2;LMP; Go ahead, Joe.;CDR
12348.2;CDR;Roger. They are having trouble verifying that the High Gain is doing its thing. Like to verify that the pitch is minus 10, the Y is plus 350, you're in Wide Beam Width and Auto. [Pause.];LMP
12370.2;LMP;Okay. Minus 10 pitch, plus 350 yaw, and Wide Beam Width and going into Auto. You want High Gain, John?;CDR
12382.2;CDR; That's affirm.;LMP
12385.2;LMP; Okay. Here, it's coming at you.;CAPCOM
12393.8;LMP;"Ah, Houston; 13.";CAPCOM
12395.8;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Go ahead.;LMP
12399.8;LMP; Is the S-IVB doing something different now?;CAPCOM
12406.8;CAPCOM; Well, I don't know. It should be - let's see, it should have started the LOX dump at least quite a while ago. I guess that's complete. Why do you ask, Fred?;LMP
12420.8;LMP;I'm looking out window 5 at what I think is the S-IVB, and I'm seeing what looks to be double plumes, growing in - it's two very narrow bands, maybe about 3 degrees, that are streaming out from it. And then there is a less dense band that covers maybe a 40-degree swath through the sky that continues out, also, in two directions.;CAPCOM
12455.8;CMP; Hey, Joe, what it looks like, kind of, is if you pull up behind a guy that's pulling a contrail, and you get in his contrail, like he's going away from you - there's a long contrail.;CAPCOM
12465.8;CAPCOM;" Okay; stand by. Let me see what Frank's got to say about that.";CMP
12469.8;LMP; Except we're between - Looks like we're between two contrails, one guy above and one below.;CAPCOM
12477.8;CAPCOM; Roger. [Pause.];LMP
12484.8;LMP; It's a very pretty sight. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
12503.8;CAPCOM;"Okay, 13; Houston. The booster says that the propulsive dump is concluded; he now has the nonpropulsive vents open and what you see is a normal phenomenon and it should go on for another 5 minutes or so.";LMP
12522.8;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
12524.8;CAPCOM;And, while I've got you, 13, at your convenience, we'd like to have the results of the EMS bias tests that you did pre-TLI and pre-Sep.;LMP
12538.8;CMP; Stand by.;CAPCOM
12540.8;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];CMP
12595.8;CMP;Okay, Joe. The TLI - the Delta-V no-bias test prior to TLI, we had a 0.8, and post-TLI, it was 1.0.;CAPCOM
12614.8;CAPCOM;Okay, Jack. Copy that. Thank you very much. Incidentally, as your tracking gets better and better, the size of MCC-2 is getting lower and lower and figures to be somewhere between 10 and 30 feet per second now.;CMP
12630.8;CMP; Sounds good.;CAPCOM
12631.8;CAPCOM; Yeah, sure does. [Long pause.];CMP
12644.8;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston.;CMP
12646.8;CMP; Go ahead, Joe.;CAPCOM
12647.8;CAPCOM;Okay. We have a PTC REFSMMAT ready, if you're ready to go P00 and Accept, we'll stick it in there.;CMP
12655.8;CMP; Okay. Stand by.;CAPCOM

12695.8;CMP;Okay. I'm P00 and Accept, Joe.;CAPCOM
12698.8;CAPCOM; Okay. Roger that.;CMP
12709.2;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston. We'll have a handover in half a minute or so. You may get a momentary loss of strength.;CMP
12716.2;CMP; Okay, Joe.;CAPCOM
12728.3;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston. The computer is yours. Over.;CMP
12731.3;CMP; Okay. Going to Block.;CAPCOM

12739.0;CMP;Okay, Houston. Do you copy 13's torqueing angles on the P52?;CAPCOM
12744.0;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Leave them up just a second, and we'll get them down.;CMP
12755.0;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Okay. We got 'em. [Long pause.];CMP
12772.0;CMP;Okay. The time of torqueing was 5 hours, 30 minutes and 40 seconds.;CAPCOM
12777.0;CAPCOM; Roger. We copy.;CDR
12785.9;CDR;"Hello, Houston; Apollo 13.";CAPCOM
12787.9;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Go ahead.;CDR
12789.9;CDR; Okay. I just got all hooked up to get in my comm system here, and I just wanted to check out. I've got my suit stowed, a few other odds and ends done, and I'm back in business again.;CAPCOM
12799.9;CAPCOM;Okay. Good deal. We're kind of hanging loose down here. I've got a Lift-off plus 15 PAD. There's no hurry to read it up, so let us know when you're ready.;CDR
12807.9;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
12902.9;CDR; Okay, Houston. Go ahead with the PAD.;CAPCOM
12906.9;CAPCOM;"Okay, Jim. Lift-off plus 15 PAD: GET<sub>I</sub>, 015:00; Delta-V<sub>T</sub>, 5622; longitude, minus 165; and GET 400K, 047:04. Over. [Pause.]";CDR

12988.9;CMP; Go ahead, Joe.;CAPCOM
12990.9;CAPCOM;" Rog. We'd like to have the Attitude Set switch back to GDC, if you're finished with your align. It gives G&amp;C down here a telemetry problem.";CMP

13117.9;CDR;And, Joe, we confirmed there's no midcourse-1. Over.;CAPCOM
13124.9;CAPCOM; That is affirmative as far as I know. Let's get a final check on it, Jim.;CDR
13129.9;CDR; Okay. Because we're standing by. We want to do a fuel cell purge and a waste water dump.;CAPCOM
13137.9;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim. We confirm that there will be no midcourse-1.;CDR
13143.9;CDR; Okay. Sounds good. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
13155.9;CAPCOM;And, 13, Houston. You can go ahead with the purge and dump at your discretion.;CDR
13160.9;CDR; Roger, Houston. What we're going to do is, we're going to get rid of Fred's suit here. Fred's suit has been right in the commander's slot here for the last half hour. So we're going to try and get it stowed.;CAPCOM

13319.3;CMP; Could you follow it all the way up, Vance?;CAPCOM
13323.3;CAPCOM; No, I didn't see staging. It was too hazy for that, but we could see it for a few miles anyway. [Pause.];CMP
13336.3;CMP; I'll tell you, it's sure an interesting ride.;CAPCOM

13444.3;CAPCOM; Okay.;CDR
13454.1;CDR; Okay, Houston. We're starting PTC. We're disabling quads A and B now.;CAPCOM
13459.1;CAPCOM;Roger, Apollo 13. Houston copies.;CDR
13553.1;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston. Over.;CDR
13556.1;CDR; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
13557.1;CAPCOM; Jim, we'd like to verify that the High Gain is secured, that the S-band antenna is on Omni, and Omni B should be the right antenna. Over.;CDR
13572.1;CDR; Okay. You want the High Gain secured and you want the Omni on Omni Charlie, huh? Or Baker?;CAPCOM
13580.1;CAPCOM; That's affirm. And this'll be maintained in the PTC.;CDR
13584.1;CDR; Okay. [Pause.];CAPCOM
13595.1;CAPCOM;And the High Gain angles for stowage - or for stowing - are pitch minus 52, yaw 270.;CDR
13602.9;CDR;Houston, Apollo 13.;CAPCOM
13605.9;CAPCOM; Roger. Go ahead.;CDR
13607.9;CDR; Stand by for another Earth weather picture. I'll give you a mark.;CAPCOM

13665.9;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
13668.9;CAPCOM; Houston here. Your rates look very stable. It looks like your rates are damped out completely here. As far as we can see, it would be alright to start the PTC.;CDR
13680.9;CDR; Okay. We'll give it a try.;CAPCOM

13695.9;CAPCOM;"13; Houston. Loud and clear. [Pause.] 13, Houston's reading loud and clear. How do you read?";LMP
13709.9;LMP; Okay. And do you have any estimate, Vance, on how long we'll be charging battery B?;CAPCOM
13722.9;CAPCOM;Stand by 1, Fred. [Long pause.];LMP
13742.9;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston.;CDR
13745.9;CDR; Go ahead.;CAPCOM

13762.7;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston.;LMP
13765.7;LMP; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
13768.7;CAPCOM; Aah, Fred, recommend that, when your window comes around facing the Earth again, that you catch another one of those pictures, and at the same time, you should probably start PTC again. We might have sent a confusing bit of info up to you. The 'disable two quads' only applies to an early step in the procedure. We didn't mean that for the latter part of the procedure where we have the statement 'enable all jets.' Over.;LMP
13804.7;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
13816.1;CMP;Houston, Apollo 13. [Pause.];CAPCOM
13826.1;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston. Go ahead.;CMP
13829.1;CMP; Vance, Fred said that you had some more information about PTC and a different way of establishing it or something, huh?;CAPCOM
13838.1;CAPCOM;Rog. Referring to the procedure on G/8-2, if you have that open, I'll tell you what we had to give you. [Pause.];CMP
13854.1;CMP; Okay. Stand by and I'll get it out.;CAPCOM
13856.1;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];CMP
13878.1;CMP; Okay. Go ahead, Vance.;CAPCOM
13881.1;CAPCOM;"Okay. On checklist G/8-2 under step 5, there's a statement, 'disable all jets on two adjacent quads,' and that's what we were referring to when we called up saying 'disable quads A and B.' So that's all fine; however, going down now to step 7 where it says 'enable all jets,' we hoped that you didn't think we meant leave A and B disabled there. In that case, it's as written. All jets should be enabled. Over.";CMP
13923.1;CMP;Okay. Our checklist has 'all jets' scratched out, and it says 'enable couples on all axes.' So what we'll do is - we'll re-establish this thing and come down to that step 7, and we'll enable all jets. That means enable quads A and B. Is that right?;CAPCOM
13945.1;CAPCOM;That's affirm. You'll have A, B, C, and D enabled for step 7.;CMP
13950.1;CMP; Okay, real fine. I'll start on it now.;CAPCOM
13954.1;CAPCOM; Okay. Understand you're going to re-establish it. [Long pause.];CMP
14009.1;LMP; And Vance, on that picture, I was all set to shoot it just a little before you called, and the Earth hasn't showed up in the window yet. I don't know if we got too far off the bellyband or what.;CAPCOM

14069.1;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston.;LMP
14073.1;LMP; Go ahead, Vance.;CAPCOM
14075.1;CAPCOM; Roger. On the photo, you'll probably have to re-establish the attitude for PTC and then whenever it comes into the window again, why we'll just be standing by for the photo. [Pause.];LMP
14089.1;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM

14116.4;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, go ahead.;LMP
14120.4;LMP; Okay. Ready for a little count here, Vance, and I'll shoot another picture. We found the Earth again.;CAPCOM
14124.1;CMP; Ah, go ahead.;CAPCOM

14214.1;CAPCOM; I think we can give you something. Stand by a minute.;CMP
14216.2;CAPCOM;"Okay. The procedure is as follows: Verb 25, Noun 07, Enter; 1331, Enter; 7, Enter; and Enter. Explanation as follows. During the P23s, there was one time when Verb 37 was entered into the computer at about 16 seconds after the Optics Zero switch was flicked to Zero. This is a very uncommon anomaly in that, if you do this during - point - four tenth of a second interval at around 16 seconds after you zero the optics, some OPT-mode bits are reset; and this would mean that, if you had a OCDU fail, it wouldn't be indicated; so all this procedure is doing is setting these three bits back again where they should be.";LMP

16955.2;CDR;Vance, to our calculations, we have taken about 10 Earth window photography pictures. I see nothing coming up here except to close the waste stowage vent here in a little while. I was thinking about getting squared away to bed down for the evening pretty soon. [Pause.];CAPCOM

17008.8;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston.;CDR
17013.8;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
17015.8;CAPCOM;A couple of items, Jim. The first is, the time for closing the waste stowage vent is 12:24. If you turn in before that time, why it's okay as far as we're concerned down here to close it before that time, just before you go to bed. The second point, we have some results on the P23s, and, if Jack's interested, we could give him the corrected altitudes we're getting, and so forth.;CMP
17053.8;CMP; Yeah. I sure am, Vance. [Pause.];CAPCOM
17061.8;CAPCOM;Okay. This is preliminary results, but it will give you some indication. Corrected altitude is turning out to be 17 plus or minus 4 kilometers, and the fact that it's plus or minus 4 kilometers indicates that you're being very consistent in judging the altitude. The effective altitude is turning out to be 10 plus or minus 12 kilometers. Comments are that, as I said before, you're being consistent on the horizon selection. The substellar point error is averaging 15 arc-minutes and if you could hold the rates to a minimum, you might shoot for 5 arc-minutes. That's the only comment there. Over.;CMP
17126.8;CMP; Okay. We'll try doing it better next time.;CAPCOM

18404.5;CAPCOM; Okeydokes. [Pause.];LMP
18414.5;CAPCOM; And we'll see you in the morning, huh?;CMP
18417.5;CMP; Okay. It'll be just a minute or two yet. We have to finish up a couple more chores.;CAPCOM
18428.5;LMP; What do you mean? It is morning.;CDR
18432.5;CAPCOM; Hey, that's right. [Long pause.];CDR
18452.5;CAPCOM; It's been a long day, huh?;CDR
18455.5;CDR; Yeah, it sure was.;CAPCOM
18463.7;CDR;Hello, Houston. Houston, Apollo 13. Over.;CAPCOM
18466.7;CAPCOM;Good morning, 13. This is Houston. How are you?;CDR
18471.7;CDR; Read you loud and clear. We had a fairly good night's sleep.;CAPCOM
18481.7;CAPCOM; Okay. Real fine. At your leisure, you can give us radiation reports, I guess. And, we're getting a consumables update together for you, and a few other little details whenever you're ready to talk. About the only major thing on the spacecraft is that it's been getting farther away.;CDR
18500.7;CDR; Okay. Well, that's to be expected, I guess.;CAPCOM
18503.7;CAPCOM; Yeah.;CDR
18511.7;LMP; And we're starting to charge battery A, Houston.;CAPCOM
18517.7;CAPCOM; Rog on battery A, Fred. EECOM says battery B looks real good.;LMP
18524.7;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CDR
18579.7;CDR;Houston, 13.;CAPCOM
18581.7;CAPCOM; Go ahead.;CDR
18584.7;CDR;" Okay. For information, Fred was on comm last night; and he was over in the left-hand seat, and if you want our radiation readings, we just goofed. We left them all in the suits which are now nicely tucked away. We're going to get out Jack's suit in an hour or so anyway, and we'll get his dosimeter out if you wanted to get the reading on that one.";CAPCOM
18606.7;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. That'll be satisfactory.;CDR
18610.7;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
18611.7;CAPCOM; And in exchange for that, the Surgeon would like to have a rough number of hours each of you slept and a qualitative verb to describe whether it was good, fair, or poor.;CDR
18623.7;CDR; Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
18639.7;CDR;Okay, Houston. We had an average of around 5Â½ hours [garble]. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
18659.7;CAPCOM; Jim, Houston. Your comm got pretty garbled there just as you started to talk. [Long pause.];CDR
18691.7;CDR;Okay. Houston, Apollo 13.;CAPCOM
18693.7;CAPCOM;Okay, 13. You're loud and clear again.;CDR
18698.7;CDR;We averaged about 5Â½ hours sleep apiece, and we're estimating that the sleep was good.;CAPCOM
18706.7;CAPCOM;Okay. Copy that. [Pause.] Let's see what else we got for you, Jim. Midcourse-2 looks like about 23 feet per second [7 m/s], approximately retrograde and on time. And it's holding real firm there. For your information, and you don't need to copy this down, because it's still pretty soft, but we have an S-IVB impact of about 8.57 south and about 33.9 west, which is a little west and a little south of the Flight Plan value. We have it at a GET of about 77 plus 51 which is just before AOS, and the LOI paths are a little bit late, and as I say, it's still pretty soft, and we'll be updating you with firm numbers.;CDR
18770.7;CDR; That's fine, Joe. Just as long as it doesn't hit Cone Crater.;CAPCOM
18775.7;CAPCOM; Okay. And I'll have a consumables update for you in a little while, and I have a small Flight Plan update for you sometime a little later on when you're ready to copy. There's no big deals in it.;CDR
18792.7;CDR; Roger.;CAPCOM
18796.7;CAPCOM;And, 13, Houston. We'd like to verify that you cycled the O<sub>2</sub> cryo fans. We saw the H<sub>2</sub>, but we didn't see the O<sub>2</sub> get stirred up.;CDR
18808.7;CMP; Yeah, Joe. We did and - kind of looked like we might have had a little stratification because right after we put them on, we had a Cryo Press light.;CAPCOM
18818.7;CAPCOM; Okay. EECOM told me that might happen, and he was right.;CMP
18887.7;CMP; Okay, Joe. We're ready to copy a Flight Plan update and your consumables.;CAPCOM
18893.7;CAPCOM;"Okay, Jack. [Pause.] The Flight Plan update has a couple of items in it, and the first one we'd like to do is to update the T<sub>ephem</sub> values in the G&amp;C checklist on page G/9-2. These are fairly small changes, but in case you need them, we'd like you to have the exact numbers. Over.";CMP
18918.7;CMP; Okay. Just a minute. I'll get it out. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
18949.7;CMP;"Joe, was that the G&amp;C checklist, page 9-2?";CAPCOM
18953.7;CAPCOM;"That's affirmative. G&amp;C, page G/9-2.";CMP
18961.7;CMP; Okay. Go ahead.;CAPCOM
18962.7;CAPCOM;Okay. On that page in line 04, column B, change the number from 03366 to 05253. Over.;CMP
18983.7;CMP;[Garble] 53.;CAPCOM
18984.7;CAPCOM;Okay. And in line 05, column B, change from 11000 to 33661. Over.;CMP
19000.7;CMP;33661.;CAPCOM
19003.7;CAPCOM;Okay. That's right. The only other thing I've got for you, Jack, is three additional questions for the booster systems debriefing, which is to take place at about 25 hours, and we thought we'd pass these questions up to you early so you can consider them. Over.;CDR
19025.7;CDR; Okay. We're ready to copy.;CAPCOM
19028.7;CAPCOM;"Okay. The first extra is, and let me get the original question because this question says, ""More specifically on item 2,"" and item 2 says, ""Were there any significant changes in the noise vibration level during the single stage of powered flight? Specifically, describe your observations during the early S-II center engine cut-off, and approximately 90 seconds prior to TLI cut-off, you reported a high vibration in the S-IVB. We'd like you to describe the build-up of this vibration and its behavior through cut-off."" Over.";CDR
19075.7;CDR; Okay. Essentially, what you'd like us to talk about is vibration sequence during the early S-II cut-off of the center engine and also describe the vibrations that we encountered during the S-IVB TLI burn. Is that correct?;CAPCOM
19090.7;CAPCOM;"That's it. Okay. The second extra question is for you, Jim, and it says, ""Comparing this flight with your ride on Apollo 8, were there any significant differences in the powered flight environment?""";CDR
19108.7;CDR;Okay. We'll describe a comparison with 8 and 13 as far as powered flight goes.;CAPCOM
19114.7;CAPCOM; Roger. And the last additional question is what did the ORDEAL ball look like during TLI? As you know, we passed you an update to that setting, and we'd like to know whether it was riding right on zero or what during the burn. Over.;CDR
19133.7;CDR; Okay. Will do. Well we'll describe the ORDEAL ball.;CAPCOM
19136.7;CAPCOM; Okay. That's it, and that's the whole Flight Plan update. I have a consumables update now if you want to listen to that.;CDR
19145.7;CDR; Okay, Joe. We're ready to copy.;CAPCOM
19147.7;CAPCOM;"Okay. At 23 hours, the total RCS is 1121, quad A is 274, quad Bravo is 286, quad Charlie is 274, quad Delta is 287; and the cryos are as follows: H<sub>2</sub> tank 1, 83 percent; H<sub>2</sub> tank 2, 86 percent; O<sub>2</sub> tank 1, 87 percent; O<sub>2</sub> tank 2, 87 percent. Over.";CMP
19200.7;CMP; Okay, Joe. We got all those, and how do we compare them with where we should be in the timeline?;CAPCOM
19208.7;CAPCOM; As I understand it, Jack, you're running slightly ahead of nominal in both those areas.;CMP
19217.7;CMP;" Okay; real fine.";CAPCOM
19218.7;CAPCOM; No problems. [Long pause.];CMP
19260.7;CAPCOM;And, 13, Houston. That's all the business I got right now. I have a little news plan of the day for you, if you feel like listening to that a little later on. [Long pause.];CMP
19283.7;CDR; Just hold off a little bit there, Joe, if you don't mind [garble].;CAPCOM
19289.7;CAPCOM; Stand by one, Jim. You're coming in garbled again.;CDR
19371.7;CMP;Houston, 13.;CAPCOM
19373.7;CAPCOM;"Okay, 13; Houston. Loud and clear again. Go ahead.";CMP
19378.7;CMP; Okay. Joe. On the news, Jim would like to hold off a little bit on that, and I want to make a request to FAO, if he will at some time during the day, when we have a - get a Flight Plan update with those activities we agreed to make optional during lunar orbit and the few activities we were going to delete, I think that I forgot and left that card back during the press of suiting, I left it in the suit room.;MCC
19406.7;MCC; Okay. Wilco.;CMP
19408.7;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. I understand FAO's working on that and we'll have something for you later on.;CMP
19415.7;CMP; Okay. We're not in any hurry.;CAPCOM
19424.5;CAPCOM; Rog.;CMP
20399.5;CMP;"Okay, Houston; 13. [Pause.]";CAPCOM
20410.5;CAPCOM; Okay. Jack. We copy the angles. You can go ahead and torque them. [Pause.];CMP
20423.5;CMP;Okay. Joe. The time of torqueing will be 23 hours, 47 minutes, 30 seconds.;CAPCOM
20429.5;CAPCOM; We copy.;CDR
20632.3;CDR;Houston, 13.;CAPCOM
20635.3;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Go ahead.;CDR
20638.3;CDR; For information, Joe, we're all configured back again now to our regular seating positions, if you're monitoring us.;CAPCOM
20646.3;CAPCOM; Okay. Thank you, Jim.;CDR
20690.9;CDR;"Hello there, Houston; 13.";CAPCOM
20696.9;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Go ahead.;CDR
20700.9;CDR; Gosh, we had forgotten, but we'd like to hear what the news is.;CAPCOM
20703.9;CAPCOM;"Okay. There's not a whole lot to it. Well, let's see, we'll start with the - Let's start with sports, what the heck. The Astros survived 8 to 7, the Braves got five or six runs in the - five runs in the ninth inning, but they just - they just made it; and in the other important game of the day, the Cubs were rained out. I have all the rest of the scores, you can tell me if you want any of them. They had earthquakes in Manila and other areas of the island of Luzon. There were three tremors and they kept the buildings shaking for about a half an hour or so, and it was about a 5 on the Richter scale. Okay, let's see. The Beatles have announced they will no longer perform as a group. The quartet is reported to have made in excess of a half billion dollars during their short musical career.

20774.9;CAPCOM;" [Laughter.] Okay. Okay; West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who witnessed your launch from the Cape yesterday, and President Nixon will complete their round of talks today. Brandt reportedly came to the U.S. to seek assurance from the President to go ahead with talks with the eastern European nations, especially East Germany, Poland, and Russia.

Over.";CDR
20918.9;CDR; Outstanding. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
20934.9;CDR;Houston, this is 13. Is it true that Jack's income tax return was going to be used to buy the ascent fuel for the LM?;CAPCOM

21001.9;CAPCOM; That's right. [Pause.];CDR
21011.9;CAPCOM;Okay, crew. About the only other thing I've got for you right now is an update to your P37 PAD for Lift-off plus 35. This is a change to the PAD we gave you yesterday. The reason for the update is for weather avoidance in the mid-Pacific landing area at 70 hours, which is the return time for this PAD, and in case the question arises in your mind, we don't expect any problem there for the end of the mission. The weather area is 20 degrees south of your end-of-mission landing point, and it appears to be moving to the south.;CDR
21049.9;CDR; Okay, Joe. I'm ready to copy the PAD.;CAPCOM
21051.9;CAPCOM;"Okay. GET of ignition is 035:00; Delta-V<sub>T</sub>, 7883; Longitude, minus 155; and the GET 400K, 069:54. Over.";CDR

21153.9;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Go.;CDR
21157.9;CDR;Okay. We've retrieved Jack's dosimeter, and it's reading 02022. [Pause.];CAPCOM
21169.9;CAPCOM;Okay. We copy 02022 on the dosimeter, Jim.;CDR
21176.9;CDR; That's affirm. [Long pause.];CAPCOM

21214.3;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston. Over.;CDR
21216.3;CDR;Houston, Apollo 13. Roger. We're thinking together. And we're here waiting for your call.;CAPCOM
21225.3;CAPCOM; Okay, you were a little broken up there, Jim, but I think it's getting better. We're ready for the launch vehicle systems debriefing whenever you are. [Long pause.];CDR
21249.3;CDR;"Okay, Houston; Apollo 13. You were cut out again; say again, please.";CAPCOM
21253.3;CAPCOM; Roger, Jim. We're ready for the launch vehicle systems debriefing whenever you are. Over.;CDR
21261.3;CDR;Okay. Stand by 1. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
21278.3;CDR;"Okay, Houston; 13. In answer to question 1, the changes in the noise level occurred mainly between the first stage and the other stages - the other stages were about the same in noise level, very quiet, but the first stage, of course, was - made quite a bit of noise in the beginning but - which built up during the high Q, and then [garble] went quiet just after high Q.";CAPCOM
21309.3;CAPCOM; Okay, copy that, Jim.;CDR
21315.3;CDR; I might mention that the noise level during the first stage was not sufficient to be uncomfortable at all.;CAPCOM
21324.3;CAPCOM; Roger. And I assume comm was okay.;CDR
21328.3;CDR; That's affirm. Comm was very good all during - throughout the entire flight. Much better than I expected.;CAPCOM
21335.3;CAPCOM; Okay.;CDR
21342.3;CDR;Now, in answer to question 2, there was, of course, a vibration transient in the second stage that - due to the number 5 engine going out - which occurred shortly before the engine went out, and slightly after that then the S-II stage was very smooth. [Pause.];CAPCOM
21371.3;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. I guess the significant point there is that you didn't notice the vibration before you saw the engine light.;CDR
21377.3;CDR;" That's right. We - we noticed the vibration but it wasn't such that we thought something catastrophic was going to happen; it just started vibration and then the EN light came on, and then the vibration went away and the stage itself was smooth.";CAPCOM
21397.3;CAPCOM; Okay, copy that.;CMP
21401.3;CMP; Yeah, and that - it was all pretty - pretty short in span - just a second or so before and like a second afterwards, Joe.;CAPCOM
21412.3;CAPCOM; Oh. Roger.;CDR
21416.3;CDR; And on the S-IVB, the vibration of the vehicle itself wasn't what [garble] second [garble] powered flight - a very high frequency vibration.;CAPCOM
21431.3;CAPCOM; That was - was that during - just during TLI, or did you notice that at insertion? [Pause.];CDR
21443.3;CDR; Well, it was a high-frequency viola - vibration but more noticeable during the TLI burn than it was during the boost [garble] flight.;CAPCOM
21457.3;CAPCOM; Okay, I - understand. [Long pause.];LMP
21471.3;LMP; I guess the S-IVB vibration during TLI was there all the time although it seemed to - to grow to us as the burn progressed, although that may have been just due to the boost weight decrease.;CAPCOM
21488.3;CAPCOM;Okay, you called this about 3Â½ minutes, but I guess the thing was slowly building up throughout the whole burn. Right?;LMP
21495.3;LMP; That's right.;CAPCOM
21498.3;CAPCOM; Okay, was it uncomfortable or did it cause your vision to degrade or anything like that?;CDR
21504.3;CDR;No, it - it was not uncomfortable at all but I was recalling the ride on 8, and the S-IVB was more - much more smooth than even it was on 13.;CAPCOM
21517.3;CAPCOM; Copy that. [Long pause.];CDR
21542.3;CDR;Okay, now, in answer to number 3, we did not experience any unexpected transients except that all of us noticed the PU shift. We thought it was more pronounced than we had expected it to be.;CAPCOM
21557.3;CAPCOM; Okay. Understand.;CMP
21560.3;CMP; Joe, on that. I guess most of every time that PU shift occurred we all - almost all of us glanced at the engine light. We could feel definite acceleration change.;CAPCOM
21571.3;CAPCOM; Rog. Understand, Jack.;CDR
21576.3;CDR; And, during the high-Q portion of the flight, the Alpha meter, to my knowledge, never went above [garble].;CAPCOM
21584.3;CAPCOM; Okay.;CDR
21592.3;CDR;In answer to number 4, we got a pretty good look at the thermal shroud and the IU after taking the LM away, and from our viewpoint, the shroud was completely intact. I saw no loose particles or parts of it floating at all.;CAPCOM
21608.3;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. Understand. [Pause.];CDR
21618.3;CDR;And, I guess we answered number 5. I don't think at any time did we have any communication problem during powered flight.;CAPCOM
21623.3;CAPCOM; Roger. [Long pause.];CDR
21637.3;CDR;In answer to number 6, the answer is essentially no. We saw no venting or suspected leak on the LM or the CSM.;CAPCOM
21652.3;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. I guess you described to us the nonpropulsive venting on the S-IVB after the APS maneuver and we copied that at the time. [Pause.];CDR
21668.3;CDR; Okay. Fred saw the S-IVB venting.;CAPCOM
21671.3;LMP; Yes, we had already talked about that, Joe. And that was also visible when it - of course, when it did its evasive maneuver when we were looking at it right close up.;CAPCOM
21682.3;CAPCOM; Roger. [Long pause.];LMP
21710.3;CDR;Okay, Joe. The last time we saw the S-IVB positively was when Fred saw it venting at about - at about 5 hours. We think we might have picked it up later on. We saw a particle or something out there that was tumbling which might have been the booster or one of the SLA panels.;CAPCOM
21732.3;CAPCOM; And when was that, Jim? [Pause.];CDR
21739.3;CDR;We're - we're debating. It was somewhere between - say 7:30 and 9 hours.;CAPCOM
21745.3;CAPCOM; Okay.;CDR
21748.3;LMP; But, Joe, assuming the S-IVB is still stable. The object I was looking at was definitely tumbling.;CAPCOM
21759.3;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. As I recall, it was stable then, although it's tumbling now.;LMP
21766.3;LMP; Okay. It probably was the SLA panel I picked up.;CAPCOM
21772.3;CAPCOM;Right. Incidentally, I guess the guys in building 6...;LMP
21775.3;CDR; Oh and I think we...;CAPCOM
21776.3;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Jim.;CDR
21777.3;CDR;I - I think we answered number 9. We - at around 5:32, I think, was when we think the number 5 light came on in the S-II, and a definite vibration which was more than just a high-frequency vibration we got with the normal S-IV burn, and then the light came on. I called ECO thinking from the training that it was 7:42 and looked up at the time and realized it was early. And then, soon after the light came on, the vibration stopped and the engine or the booster smoothed down. It was very smooth from there on. [Pause.];CAPCOM
21817.3;CAPCOM; Okay. This may be a stupid question, but do you have any idea of what the frequency of it was?;CDR
21826.3;CDR; Only to say that it was much higher - I couldn't really guess now. It was rather a rapid longitudinal vibration. [Pause.];CAPCOM
21841.3;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. Stand by now for a minute, we're going to switch omni.;CDR
21926.3;CDR;Houston, 13, [garble];CAPCOM
21929.3;CAPCOM;13, Houston. I read you. We still have quite a bit of noise on the loop.;CDR
21937.3;CDR; I'll stand by. Roger.;CAPCOM
21942.3;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim. It should be pretty good now. We copied you answering question number 9.;CDR
21954.3;CDR; Do you want any more comments on the S-IVB vibration?;CAPCOM
21958.3;CAPCOM;"I don't think so. When you get all done, I'll - I'll make a quick check to see if the booster people have any - any additional questions. You skipped number 8, Jim; could you go back to that for a second?";CDR
21972.3;CDR; Okay, stand by. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
21992.3;CDR;"Our only comment there, Joe, was that the burn on TLI, to our knowledge, was about 3Â¾ second longer than had been predicted and that was the only thing that we really noticed; otherwise, looked like V<sub>I</sub> was nominal at cut-off.";CAPCOM
22009.3;CAPCOM; Okay, understand. [Long pause.];CDR
22021.3;CDR;Okay, on comparing the flight of 13 to Apollo 8, lift-off was about the same amount of vibration as I noticed on 8, but at the beginning of the flight, there was less of the sideways motion than we experienced on Apollo 8. The S-IC separation felt more violent on 13 than it did on 8, maybe that's because I was in a different seat, I don't know. But there was about three sharp transients of the cut-off and a couple of big bangs where we were thrown backwards longitudinally on our straps before the S-II went off. And the S-II was, of course, just as smooth on 13 as 8 except for the number 5 engine. And we did not experience the vibration that we experienced on 8 towards the end of the S-II burn. And the S-IVB was - had more vibration than we had on 8.;CAPCOM
22089.3;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim, got all that.;CDR
22097.3;CDR;The up - the update on the ORDEAL ball was a good one. At the burn, we were about - just about 8 degrees. We had to pitch down. The yaw was right on, all the way through the entire burn, and just towards the end of the burn, the ball started going back in pitch a little bit. [Pause.];CAPCOM
22121.3;CAPCOM;Okay, sounds good, we'll give Mike Wash a gold star on that one. [Pause.] Okay, Jim, stand by 1 while I see if we have any extra questions. [Long pause.];CDR
22162.3;CAPCOM; Jim, while we're waiting to see if they have any more questions, I'd like to read you the booster people's preliminary analysis on the - the S-II cut-off. Over.;CDR
22176.3;CDR; That's very interesting. Go ahead.;CAPCOM
22178.3;CAPCOM;Okay, preliminary analysis of the data indicates that the center S-II engine vibrated at a somewhat higher amplitude than we've seen on previous flights, and it started at about 160 seconds into the S-II burn. As a result of these vibrations, the engine chamber pressure decreased to the level where the two low-level thrust sensors, the thrust-okay sensors, initiated center engine cut-off. Early evaluation of data indicates that no damage occurred to the engine, and the cause of the increased vibration amplitude is still under investigation. Over. [Pause.];CDR
22221.3;CDR; I'm glad it was the center engine.;CAPCOM
22226.3;CAPCOM; Yeah, right. [Pause.];CDR
22236.3;CDR; Joe, do you have any word on what marks we had for TLI?;CAPCOM
22242.3;CAPCOM;At the time of TLI, as I recall, you had 6 seconds longer than the nominal burn which was 3 seconds longer than the 3-sigma low burn, and you were also Go for a second-opportunity TLI if we had required one. [Pause.];CDR
22262.3;CDR; Okay, we were just wondering because it appeared to us that we had a longer TLI burn than had been predicted.;CAPCOM
22268.3;CAPCOM;Yes, you did. We confirmed that - that - that cut-off time just about as you saw it, and I don't have an explanation for it, but it was within the 3-sigma margins.;CDR
22345.3;CAPCOM;13, Houston.;CDR
22347.3;CDR; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
22349.3;CAPCOM; Roger, we have no further questions. All the answers were clear and satisfactory, and we thank you very much. You can press on with the rest of your busy day.;CDR
22360.3;CDR; Right-o.;CAPCOM
22379.9;LMP;"And, Houston; 13.";CAPCOM
22384.9;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Go ahead.;LMP
22389.9;LMP;Okay, Joe. Out window 5, I just picked up the tumbling object again so, for sure, it must have been a SLA panel. I don't think we could still be in the proximity of the S-IV at this time.;CAPCOM
22404.9;CAPCOM;I don't think so, Fred. It's several hundred miles aft of you. 700 miles is - is the number, I'm told. And since the SLA panel didn't make the midcourse correction, that might be it. [Pause.];LMP
22422.9;LMP; Yes, it's - I can't really tell for sure even through the monocular that it is, but it looks the same relative position to the stars. And the best I can tell, about the same intensity and still about the same distance from us.;CAPCOM
22439.9;CAPCOM; Can you see it tumbling. Does it have a shape, or is it a point?;LMP
22450.9;LMP;" No. I can tell it's tumbling; I guess the flat side not only is facing me, it's not only much brighter, it also grows larger.";CAPCOM
22465.9;CAPCOM; Okay. Very interesting. We'll see if we can figure out where that's at relative to you. They keep updating the S-IV impact on us a little bit. The last guess we had was that it'll impact about the same longitude we gave you but close to zero latitude and a little bit later. You still won't be able to see it. And they're saying it might make a...;LMP
22493.9;LMP; Roger.;CAPCOM
22494.9;CAPCOM;...they're saying it might make a 100- to 120-foot crater, too. [Pause.];LMP
22504.9;LMP; It'll - it'll still be past the terminator for us for a while.;CAPCOM
22510.9;CAPCOM;Right. It will be at about the rev 20 terminator, so it will be late in your lunar orbit activities before you'll be able to photograph it, and FAO is looking at whether we can work that in or not.;LMP
22527.9;LMP; Okay.;CMP
22540.3;CMP;Houston, 13.;CAPCOM
22543.3;CAPCOM;13, Houston.;CMP
22547.3;CMP; Hey, Joe? Is FAO ready to - or do you - or are you ready to give me those items that we made optional and deleted in the solo book?;CAPCOM
22558.3;CAPCOM; Jack, we're not quite ready with that yet, but we will be before too long. Can you wait awhile?;CMP
22567.3;CMP; Sure can. I got lots of time.;CAPCOM
22568.3;CAPCOM; Okay.;CDR
22573.9;CDR;"Hello, Houston; Apollo 13.";CAPCOM
22581.9;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Go ahead.;CDR
22586.9;CDR; Just a passing comment, Joe. We're having lunch right now, and I just made myself a hotdog sandwich with catsup. Very tasty and almost unheard of in the old days.;CAPCOM
22599.9;CAPCOM;That's correct, 13. As I recall the Flight Plan, you're supposed to put mustard on the hot dogs and not catsup, but I guess we'll overlook that.;CMP
22610.9;CMP; We blew it.;CAPCOM
22612.9;CAPCOM; Right. How's everything going?;CDR
22620.9;CDR; Ah, Pretty good. We have about four different methods of spreading catsup, right now.;CAPCOM
22626.9;CAPCOM; Okay. Jack, we'll have your update to you before too long.;CMP
22633.9;CMP; Okay. Fine, Joe. We did a pit check on the Hycon camera and everything works okay.;CAPCOM
22641.9;CAPCOM; Okay. Beautiful. We don't have anything else for you at the moment.;LMP
22648.1;LMP;Houston, 13.;CAPCOM
22653.1;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Go ahead. [Pause.];LMP
22660.1;LMP; Okay. We'd like to get the FM up now to look at some inside pictures there.;CAPCOM
22668.1;CAPCOM; Okay. Stand by and I'll get a Go on this. [Long pause.];LMP
22721.1;CAPCOM;13, Houston.;LMP
22725.1;LMP; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
22726.1;CAPCOM;That's acceptable, Fred, and meanwhile, when you guys are ready to copy, we've got an MCC-2 PAD for you.;LMP
22737.1;LMP;Okay. Stand by 1.;CAPCOM
22739.1;CAPCOM;Roger that. And also if you can go to P00 and Accept conveniently, we'd like to uplink. [Pause.];LMP
22755.1;LMP; Okay. You've got it.;CAPCOM
22757.1;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];LMP
22790.1;LMP;Okay, Joe. You can go ahead with the P30 PAD.;CAPCOM
22795.1;CAPCOM;"Okay. Here we go.

22975.1;CAPCOM; Roger. Readback correct. I have two more short comments on them, but I want to wait just a second and make sure I understand them before I pass them to you.;LMP
22989.1;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
23009.1;CAPCOM;" Okay, Fred; Houston.";LMP
23014.1;LMP; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
23015.1;CAPCOM;The two additional comments were just that, first of all, they biased Delta-V<sub>C</sub> by minus 0.34 feet per second based on your EMS null bias checks. That's just for information. And the second one also for information is that your targeted pericynthion is 60 miles [111 km] after this correction. [Pause.];LMP
23049.1;LMP;Okay, understand. For Jack's information, the EMS Delta-V bias is 3.4, and our targeted pericynthion after this maneuver is 60 miles.;CAPCOM
23065.1;CAPCOM;That's correct on the pericynthion. The EMS bias is 0.34, very small.;LMP
23072.1;LMP;Okay. 0.34 on the EMS Delta-V bias.;CAPCOM
23077.1;CAPCOM; Roger. And...;LMP
23080.1;CMP; Hey, Joe, we'll give...;CAPCOM
23082.1;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Jack...;CMP
23083.1;CMP; We'll give you - we'll give you the read - we'll give you the results of another null bias test for comparative purposes right before the - oh, at the proper time.;CAPCOM
23092.1;CAPCOM;" Okay. Real fine; and the computer is yours.";CMP
23096.1;CMP; Okay. Thank you. Going Block.;CAPCOM
23099.9;CMP;"Okay, Houston; 13. Are you copying the torqueing angles on the P52?";CAPCOM
23103.9;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. Give us a second. [Long pause.];CMP
23121.9;CAPCOM;And, 13, Houston. We have them. You can torque them.;CMP
23125.9;CMP;"Okay, Joe. Time of torqueing; 29 hours, 0 minute, 30 seconds.";CAPCOM

23143.1;CMP; Go ahead, Joe.;CAPCOM
23144.1;CAPCOM; Hey, you've got a new CapCom on now with the Black Crew, and we have about three items to give you, Jack.;CMP
23154.1;CMP;Okay. Stand by 1. Are these updates or what?;CAPCOM
23160.1;CAPCOM; I'm going to give you some High Gain Antenna angles for TV and the rest is just information, general words.;CDR
23172.1;CDR; Go ahead there, Vance.;CAPCOM
23174.1;CAPCOM;"Okay. Burn attitude for TV, your pitch and yaw angles are as follows: Pitch, minus 1 - minus 69; yaw, 180; High Gain.";CMP
23190.1;CMP; Okay.;CAPCOM

23198.1;CMP; Okay. Real fine.;CAPCOM
23200.1;CAPCOM;And the last item's for Jack. Jack, preliminary indications are that you can get a 60-day extension on your - filing your income tax if you're out of the country.;CMP
23218.1;CMP; That's good news. I guess I qualify.;CAPCOM
23224.1;CAPCOM; Yeah, we were just looking at the map, and you're south of Florida so you're not in the country now. [Pause.] But we wondered how about your car tags. Have you taken care of those?;CMP
23244.1;CMP; Yeah, I did, as a matter of fact. I think I did.;CAPCOM
23252.1;LMP; Known as, 'plan ahead.';CAPCOM
23254.1;CAPCOM; Okay. Good. [Long pause.];CMP
23276.1;CAPCOM;And, Apollo 13, Houston. Recommend Omni Alpha until you get to the burn attitude.;CMP

23296.1;CMP;"Okay, Houston; Apollo 13.";CAPCOM
23298.1;CAPCOM;13, go ahead.;CMP
23302.1;CMP;Okay, Vance. The EMS Delta-V pass passive, the results of the no-bias pass in 100 seconds, have been from 100 to 101.5.;CAPCOM
23316.1;CAPCOM;Roger. Copy plus 100 to plus 101.5, and that agrees fairly closely with the last one, as I recall.;CMP
23324.1;CMP; Okay. Fine.;CAPCOM
23332.1;CMP;Okay, Houston. We're at P40 burn attitude. Jim is on the sextant star check, and we do have a star in the sextant.;CAPCOM
23342.1;CAPCOM; Roger, Jack. Copy. Very good.;CMP
23348.1;CMP;But we couldn't tell you whether it's 44 or not.;CAPCOM
23354.1;CAPCOM; Whoops. [Long pause.];CMP
23390.1;CMP;"Okay, Houston; 13. We're a little bit ahead of ourselves. Do we have a Go to do the fuel cell purge and the waste water dump? [Pause.]";CAPCOM

23427.1;CAPCOM; Jim, battery A is charged now. Whenever you want to unhook it will be fine with us.;CDR
23434.1;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
23440.3;CMP;Houston, 13. Are you still planning to have TV at the scheduled time? [Pause.];CAPCOM
23452.3;CAPCOM;"Okay, 13; Houston. That's affirm. At the Flight Plan-scheduled time.";CMP
23457.3;CMP; Okay. All right. [Pause.] We've got a beautiful sight we want to show you. [Pause.];CAPCOM
23472.3;CAPCOM; Right. [Long pause.];CMP
23483.3;CAPCOM;13, Houston. You can go ahead with the TV now. We're standing by. [Long pause.];CMP
23499.3;CMP; Okay. Here it comes.;CAPCOM
23500.3;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];CMP
23549.3;CAPCOM; Okay. Jack. It's coming in, and it's right in the center of our screen.;CMP
23556.3;CMP; Okay, Vance.;LMP
23560.3;LMP; Can you - Think you could guess what that might be, Vance? Better than Charlie?;CMP
23570.3;CAPCOM; I don't want to start flipping coins at this point.;CMP
23577.3;CMP;Okay, Vance. We're pointed just a little ways off from looking directly at the Moon. Jim is holding the camera through window 3. The Sun is coming at about 40 degrees off our left side, and what we are going to show you in just a minute is about 30 seconds of waste water dump and just show you just what it looks like. It's really fantastic.;CAPCOM
23605.3;CAPCOM; Okay. We'd like to see that. [Long pause.];CMP
23645.3;CAPCOM; Okay. We saw some droplets speeding out for a little while, Jack. Now we don't see anything.;CMP
23656.3;CDR; Actually, Vance, what you're looking at is solid water droplets coming out just about all the time. It lights up the whole sky around the Moon. It's just far too fine for you to see. Now I think they're coming out a little thicker.;CAPCOM
23669.3;CAPCOM; Okay. Yeah, we see those.;CDR
23677.3;CDR; Jack's complaining about seeing stars. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
23692.3;CAPCOM; FIDO says he can understand why that would perturbate a trajectory now. [Pause.];CDR
23702.3;CDR; It's amazing watching these little frozen droplets maneuver. They seem to go in all directions, but finally after they get out a certain ways, settle down and they all seem to be traveling about the same direction. [Pause.];CAPCOM
23718.3;CAPCOM; Right. That's coming in real well. [Pause.];CDR
23727.3;CDR; The objects in the foreground are parts of the LM that you're looking at. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
23747.3;CDR; The camera is now going to [garble]. [Pause.];CAPCOM
23754.3;CAPCOM; We can just barely see those parts of the LM. They must be in a shadow. [Long pause.];CDR
23770.3;CDR; Okay. Now you are looking at a thruster quad at the lower part of your screen.;CAPCOM
23777.3;LMP;"I've got the f-stop all the way open now, Vance; that's quad [pause] quad 1 you're looking at with the LM should - The Moon should be in view just over the top of the quad.";CDR
23794.3;CAPCOM; Right. We see the nozzle of the quad, but it's dark and it's not easy to see. [Long pause.];LMP
23824.3;CAPCOM;13, Houston. INCO suggests you try Average if you're in Peak to see if that gives us a better picture. [Pause.];LMP
23837.3;LMP; Okay. We're in Average now. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
23858.3;CAPCOM; I think that helps out. We can see it better. [Long pause.];INCO
23862.3;INCO; Okay Flight. We - we shouldn't leave it there too long.;CAPCOM
23879.3;CAPCOM;Okay. Now, 13, request you either move it away from the bright area or else move it back to Peak. Over. [Long pause.];LMP
23924.3;LMP; Okay, Vance. I cranked the focus down a little bit. Is the quad coming in any better now?;CAPCOM
23933.3;CAPCOM; It's coming in about the same, Fred, and you're a little weak now on the comm. [Pause.];LMP
23948.3;CAPCOM; We could see when you went back to Peak.;LMP
23954.3;LMP; And I'm now zoomed all the way out. [Pause.];CAPCOM
23966.3;CAPCOM; Okay. We could see you zoom in on the Moon, and it's near the center of our screen, just a little to the left. Very clear. [Pause.];LMP
23985.3;LMP;Yeah. I show it just about at 38.;CAPCOM
23992.3;CAPCOM; We can't tell if it's gray or light brown, though. [Long pause.];LMP
24009.3;LMP; Do you have your grid down there, Vance? [Pause.];CAPCOM
24019.3;CAPCOM; That's negative, Fred.;LMP
24024.3;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
24067.3;LMP; I don't know if you can make out the features there, Vance, on the Moon, but it looks like the terminators are at central plains area somewhere around Descartes, maybe.;CAPCOM
24081.3;CAPCOM; Okay. We're - We see it just as a bright portion of the lunar disk, and it looks a lot like you see it from Earth. Very bright. We're unable to see any features at all. [Pause.];LMP
24105.3;LMP; It's pretty much the same with the eyeballs in here, and it looks a little bigger now. But the only way I could see it very good at all was with the monocular, a little while ago. [Pause.];CAPCOM
24127.3;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. Very good. We'd be interested to see in the cabin when you get ready for that, too.;LMP
24135.3;LMP; Okay. I'll set up now. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
24155.3;CDR;And, Vance, we're counting down to midcourse-2, we're up to, in our checklist, to minus 6 minutes to go.;CAPCOM
24164.3;CAPCOM;Roger. Minus 6 minutes. Understand you're about ready to turn on the gimbal motors and all that sort of thing. Okay. We see the computer now in the upper middle part of the - the panel. I think we see somebody's checklist in the center couch. It must be Jim holding the checklist. [Pause.];CDR
24195.3;LMP; Right. And what Jim's holding now, he's got a pen in his hand we've rigged on a string, as sort of a simple-minded accelerometer. This burn's pretty short and I'm not sure even that's going to show very much. But we'll see if it'll stretch out at the end of its string.;CAPCOM
24218.3;CAPCOM; Yeah. We see the pencil at the top of the picture floating around. And Jack's coming into view now.;LMP
24226.3;LMP; And I've gone back - Okay, I've gone back to Average now and [garble] the picture.;CAPCOM
24234.3;CAPCOM; Roger.;LMP
24250.1;LMP; Now in about a few minutes, Vance, I guess we'll see how about the only system we haven't used yet works. Everything else sure has worked mighty fine.;CAPCOM
24262.1;CAPCOM;Right. The spacecraft's really working nicely. Okay. We're picking up panel 2 now. Still a little bit of the checklist. [Long pause.];LMP
24299.1;LMP; Just wondering if you can pick up the caution array there?;CAPCOM
24302.1;CAPCOM; Right. We just saw your - your testing of the caution and warning system at the left-hand side of the panel on our TV. [Pause.] See the lights all flash on. You're doing it again. [Long pause.];LMP
24356.1;CAPCOM; You mission timer's showing up as a - a brilliant green in the upper left-hand part of the picture. [Pause.];LMP

24548.1;CAPCOM; We - we can see your fuel and oxidizer gauges and hydrogen/oxygen gauges at the top of the picture and the PUGS, but it isn't coming in in focus too well. It's a little dim.;LMP
24562.1;LMP;Yes. I think the problem is I'm about 2 feet and it doesn't go down but to 4. [Pause.];CAPCOM

25229.1;CMP; The big problem here is, when you move the TV around, this wire follows you like a snake here.;CAPCOM
25237.1;CAPCOM; Yeah, we have Fred now. Looks like he has a lariat there, getting ready to rope the checklist. [Pause.];CMP
25249.1;LMP; That's only half of it. We have most of it hidden away. [Pause.] It's been pretty interesting doing all the camera work here to get a little extra training running the TV here, hopefully for when we get on the ground at Fra Mauro. The monitor does make it pretty easy though. [Pause.];CAPCOM
25274.1;CAPCOM; Right. That's a real advantage in the cockpit. You're just a little bit dark. It looks like it might help to have the f-stop run down about one increment. See how it comes out...;LMP

25340.1;CDR; I say, you know the new - the new fad with long hair?;CAPCOM

25344.1;CDR; It doesn't work too well up in space, you can't comb your hair up here.;CAPCOM
25349.1;CAPCOM; Well, I guess you have to give up something. [Pause.];CDR
25358.1;CAPCOM; Well, at least it - it helps to try. We can see you trying to comb your hair there, Jim. It looks like your - your beards haven't come along to the point where you've had to use the razor though.;CDR
25373.1;CDR; Well, we've been debating that. We thought we'd take care of our beards tomorrow and make that one of our daily routines. [Pause.];CAPCOM
25388.1;LMP; I take it that was a subtle hint, Vance.;CAPCOM
25393.1;CAPCOM; No, no. We're not commenting on your appearance, Fred. I mean nothing derogatory, understand. [Pause.];LMP
25402.1;CDR; And, Vance, I thought we'd get a picture of Jack just so that all the girls know that he's still here. [Laughter.] Say hello to them.;CMP

25453.1;CDR; Think I'm smiling.;CAPCOM
25454.1;CAPCOM;Hey, there we go. [Pause.] Incidentally, we've been getting all kinds of bits of information to pass up to you. We've had baseball scores coming in, basketball. Somebody said there's 220 days, shopping days left 'til Christmas. [Pause.];CDR
25488.1;CMP; Yeah, who won the Masters, Vance? [Pause.];CAPCOM
25498.1;CAPCOM;It was a tie in the Masters and stand by. [Pause.] It was a tie between Littler and Casper after 72 holes, and there's going to be a playoff Monday, we understand. [Long pause.];CMP
25518.1;CMP; Oh. Sounds good. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
25537.1;CAPCOM; One thing the world might be interested in knowing is what you do after the burn in the way of configuring switches back. We - We heard you go through the checklist. But, I guess right now, basically, you probably have all the switches back in position and you're in a mode to continue on with - Okay. What does the Flight Plan say? You're going to be doing cislunar navigation. So, Jack you're going to be down in the LEB. Is that correct?;CMP
25574.1;CMP; That's right, Vance. Be going down there shortly. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
25592.1;CAPCOM; Okay. The TV now is all but black. Looks like it must be pointing into a shadow.;CMP
25601.1;CMP; What he's doing there, he's trying to give you one more shot of the Moon, and right now I'm setting up to maneuver to the optics calibration attitude.;CAPCOM
25609.1;CAPCOM; Roger. [Pause.];CMP
25617.1;LMP;And what I wanted to point out, I don't know if it's apparent, but to show the advantage of doing all the dumps just before the burn, we're looking again at the same scene over quad 1 at the Moon. And now you don't see all the sparkly frozen particles outside there anymore. We've sort of run off and left them.;CAPCOM
25644.1;CAPCOM; Rog. We - We don't see anything out there anymore in the way of particles leaving the spacecraft. We'd suggest, maybe you zoom the Moon in a little bit again so we can see the shape of it better. [Long pause.];LMP
25681.1;CAPCOM; Okay. That brings the Moon in. We can see the terminator at the top of the melon-shaped disk.;LMP
25693.1;LMP; Okay. Now you can see a few of the spark - sparkling particles going across the screen. Those are being emitted from the thrusters. Jack's maneuvering the spacecraft now. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
25716.1;CAPCOM; Okay. We can see those very poorly. Well, actually, they're coming in better now. It looks like little specks going from the upper left part of the screen across to the right, and understand those are from the thrusters.;LMP
25734.1;LMP; That's affirm.;CAPCOM
25814.1;CAPCOM;"Okay, 13; Houston. Just as an item of interest, advise your speed with respect to the Earth now is 4,667 feet per second [1,423 m/s].";CMP
25831.1;CMP; Okay. Thanks, Vance. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
25863.1;CAPCOM;"Okay, Apollo 13; Houston. The Moon has been in and out of the - the - our screen here. Right now it's off at the bottom side, but we can still see the particles coming off from the spacecraft.";CMP
25882.1;CMP; Okay. I'll have to pull it out the window now, Vance. The Sun's coming up on the right side.;CAPCOM
25888.1;CAPCOM; Roger. Understand. You...;CDR
25889.1;CDR; Do you want to see any shots down in the LEB, Vance?;CAPCOM
25893.1;CAPCOM; Say again.;CDR
25897.1;CDR; Do you want to see any of the photographs or do you want the TV down in the LEB?;CAPCOM
25902.1;CAPCOM; That's right, Jim. It'd be good to see what you're doing down in the LEB or the far corner of the spacecraft where the optics are. Might be interesting to describe what you will do in the next few minutes in the way of sightings.;LMP
25921.1;LMP; Okay, Vance. First we're going to give you a shot of the sleep station. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
25944.1;CAPCOM; Okay. The camera's bounced around a little, but we can see the green computer come in every once in a while. [Long pause.];CDR
25981.1;CDR; While Jack's getting the sleep station rolled up, I thought I'd show you one interesting corner. We've got a temporary stowage bag here and that's where all our wastepaper and all that goes while we're - after every meal. It's in the right-hand corner down by our dump system.;CAPCOM
25998.1;CAPCOM; Roger. Understand. We're looking at the wastebasket. [Pause.];CDR
26008.1;CDR; And the age-old question that's always asked us is how do we get rid of liquid waste and that line that you see, I think you can see it now, it goes right outside where we open up the overboard drain dump, and all of our waste products, liquid waste products, go out through that line and get dumped overboard.;CAPCOM
26027.1;CAPCOM; Roger. Understand, and we can see somebody's foot, as well.;CDR
26033.1;CDR; Okay. Fred's now going down there, and he is going to try to get underneath the sleep station on his side where we have a sleep restraint. And the whole object of that is to - merely to position the body between the - between the bottom of the spacecraft and - so it doesn't float up between that and the bottom of the couch.;CAPCOM
26056.1;CAPCOM; Roger. The sleep restraint of the hammock is coming into view underneath the couch. It's the white object. [Pause.];CDR
26069.1;CDR; You perhaps can see the zipper of the hammock right now. It's the black lines in that white object.;CAPCOM
26076.1;CAPCOM; Right. We can see it.;CDR
26081.1;CDR; Vance, these hammocks, by the way, are very comfortable. When we first heard about them in the design of Apollo, we thought they weren't necessary, but they turned out to be very nice devices to sleep in. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
26117.1;CDR; I'm trying now to get down there with Fred to show you how it works. I keep floating up, though, but maybe we can get a little shot here. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
26144.1;CAPCOM; Okay. We have somebody upside down in the photograph there now. [Pause.] Realizing, of course, in - in space there is no really right-side up or upside down. It still looks that way to us. [Pause.];CDR
26172.1;CDR; Okay. That's - That's Fred now. I'm trying to put him right-side up, for you folks back there in the sleep station. Fred, would you move your hands there so the folks back home can see you?;CAPCOM
26185.1;CAPCOM; Okay. That's coming in real clear, Jim. We see Fred in the sleep restaint - restraint. [Pause.];CDR
26198.1;CDR; As a matter of fact, Vance, I find my - I find Fred down there all the time.;CAPCOM
26206.1;CAPCOM; Yeah. I can see he appreciates that. [Pause.] Looks fairly comfortable. [Long pause.];CDR
26230.1;CAPCOM; Looks like there's a lot of room down there, considering all the boxes on the floor underneath the couch.;CDR
26238.1;CDR; It's surprising. There still is quite a bit of room down there even with the Hycon camera box down. And right now, I'm going to bring the camera back up. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
26277.1;CDR; Okay, Vance. If there is no more that you would like to see right now, we'll terminate our little TV for you today.;CAPCOM
26283.1;CAPCOM; Okay. Thank you very much, Jim. Appreciated seeing inside the spacecraft and getting a look at the Moon that you're rapidly approaching.;CDR

In addition, the photographs might not show as much as the eye can see of the comet, so if you see anything interesting about the structure of the comet, why, sketching it is in order and is encouraged. Over.;CMP
27200.9;CMP;" Okay, Vance. What we'll do is, when we get to attitude, we'll disable the quads and do like we did last night; we'll let GUIDO and you people down there tell us when you think we are stable enough; then we'll do all this work with the DAC on the sextant, first; and then when we get that done, we'll go back and put the sextant eyepiece back on and see what we can observe visually.";CAPCOM
27228.9;CAPCOM; Okay. That sounds good. Also, while you are waiting for the vehicle to stabilize, it might be interesting to have the eyepiece on and be looking at it visually. Okay. Next item: your SPS burn had no anomalies whatsoever. It was a very good burn.;CMP
27262.9;CMP; Okay. Very good.;CAPCOM
27265.9;CAPCOM;Next item: request hydrogen tank 1 Heater, Off, for balancing purposes. [Long pause.];CMP
27292.9;CAPCOM;And Apollo 13, another item: something that we have observed and you might be seeing is a slight T<sub>CE</sub> fluctuation on fuel cell 3. This fluctuation has been going from about 152 to 160 over a 37-second period. It has been seen on other flights in the past. No one is worried about it, but the usual fluctuation is about 1Â½ degrees instead of 7 seconds, so I thought you should be aware of it.;CMP
27337.9;CMP;Okay, Vance. And one other slight distinction we've noted is the flow of hydrogen versus the oxygen is not exactly matched on fuel cell 3 either.;CAPCOM
27356.9;CAPCOM;Okay. We copy. And the last item: we'd like to send you an IRIG update, so at your convenience, request P00 and Accept. [Pause.];CMP
27376.9;CDR;Okay. We are in P00 and Accept, Vance.;CAPCOM
27379.9;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];CDR
27410.9;CMP; Quad C and D are disabled, Vance.;CAPCOM
27414.9;CAPCOM; Roger. Disabled. And down here, we see that your hydrogen and oxygen on the fuel cell are exactly matched, so we suspect it's purely a spacecraft read-out problem.;CMP
27430.9;CMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
27596.9;CMP;Okay, Vance, let us know when you're through with the DSKY so we can load Noun 88? [Pause.];CAPCOM
27610.9;CAPCOM; Roger. We'll let you know, Jack. [Long pause.];CMP
27652.9;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston. The computer's yours, again.;CMP
27701.3;CAPCOM; Okay. You're Go for the pictures.;CMP
27706.3;CMP;Okay, Vance. We tried our Auto Optics and couldn't pick it up there. We're pointing pretty much right into the Sun, and things are pretty well washed out. And I've gone to Manual Optics and I'm trying to get 0.8, 12.5 on the shaft and trunnion, and I still can't pick it up. So - it's very light in the sextant, so I kind of think maybe we're too near the Sun to see it.;CAPCOM
27733.3;CDR; That's right, Vance. The sextant is all - it's - it's all milky and it - any comet that could be seen through there is just going to be missed in the background.;CAPCOM
27746.3;CAPCOM; Okay, we copy that. We got some discussion. Stand by.;CDR
27860.3;CMP;"Okay, Vance, it isn't - we're not looking into the Sun - what we are getting is a large reflection from the Sun behind us off the LM; and it is - it is coming on that quad 1 there, and that quad is reflecting back into the sextant.";CAPCOM
27879.3;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. Understand. Just a question: if you look through the telescope, can you see the comet at all? Over.;CMP
27892.3;CMP; No, I can't, Vance. It's - it's still too light. [Long pause.];SC
27908.3;SC; Does that;CMP
27920.3;CAPCOM; Stand by.;LMP
27955.1;LMP; Say, Vance?;CAPCOM
27960.1;CAPCOM; Roger. Go ahead.;LMP
27965.1;LMP; Are the flowers blooming yet?;CAPCOM
27970.1;CAPCOM; Gee, I sure haven't seen any.;LMP
27974.1;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
27975.1;CAPCOM; Hey, we've - we've got quite a discussion down here on your trying to observe the comet, and this reflection is not unexpected. And give us another minute, and we'll be back with you on something on that.;CDR
27996.1;CDR; Okay. I doubt very seriously though, if we take any photographs with high-speed black and white with the light coming into the sextant that you're going to get anything out of it. [Pause.];CAPCOM
28012.1;CAPCOM; Okay. Unanimous opinion is that you're right, and we'll scratch all of this Bennett Comet stuff on the way out, with the hope that conditions will be more favorable after TEI. Over.;CDR
28034.1;CDR; Sounds good. Without the LM, we may have a better chance.;CAPCOM
28040.1;CAPCOM; Roger. [Long pause.];CDR
28059.1;CAPCOM;And Apollo 13, you're Go for PTC. Your rates are very low according to what we can read.;CDR

28265.1;CAPCOM; Okay.;CDR
28304.5;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston.;CDR
28308.5;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
28310.5;CAPCOM;Just something to think about. In about 30 minutes, we can generate the PADs that we have yet to send up before the sleep period, so we could support an earlier sleep period if you so desired. And - but, it will take us 30 minutes to get that stuff. The other thing is any time you're ready to copy, I can read up the solo book changes. Over - And, also, two pages in the Flight Plan.;CDR
28344.5;CDR; Okay, Vance. We're about ready to copy the solo book changes and the Flight Plan changes, and whenever your PADs are ready, we'll take those. And as far as moving up the sleep period, that's fine, but we'll - if we don't go to sleep right away, we'll use it to get out some of our lunar maps and study them.;CAPCOM
28364.5;CAPCOM; Okay. And we'll get busy getting those PADs for you as soon as possible then, and I'll stand by on the copying bit.;CMP

30751.5;CAPCOM; Roger. Just a reminder you have to disable Charlie and Delta here as you've done in the past. Over.;CMP
30758.5;CMP; Okay. I was kind of holding off on this. We're dumping a little waste water now.;CAPCOM
30766.5;CAPCOM; Okay. FIDO says he knew it all along. He's - he says he's been very concerned that you've been doing a lot of water dumping.;CMP
30799.5;CMP; Okay, Vance. We've got quad C and B disabled.;CAPCOM
30805.5;CAPCOM; Okay. Copy, Jack.;CMP
30816.7;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston.;CMP
30820.7;CMP; Go ahead.;CAPCOM

30845.5;CMP; Go ahead, Vance.;CAPCOM
30846.5;CAPCOM;"Okay. We've got about three items. First one is, all of your P23 batch - two marks have been evaluated and - Hey, congratulations. Looks real good; they're very happy with it. You're down to 4 arc-minutes on the substellar-point aspect of it, and that's the first thing to mention. The second is, unless you see a need, I don't see any need for you to read back the information we gave you on the solo book and so forth. Do you concur?";CMP
30884.5;CMP; Roger. I think I got it. I remembered a lot of it, and so I think with what you gave me and what I remember, I'm pretty sure we got it right. [Pause.];CAPCOM
30900.5;CAPCOM; Okay, and the third item, I was just about to call that your rates were stabilized to start the PTC, but it looks like they're jiggling around again from a dump, so we'll stand by some more.;CMP

31963.6;CAPCOM;Jim, just an item for you and Fred to be thinking about in case you haven't been briefed on this, something that's now being talked about a little bit. These conservative people would like to have you read the SHe tank pressure when you go into the LM for the LM familiarization at 58 hours. If there's no midcourse-3, and it looks like there's a good chance that there will not be, why, they might want to move the LM familiarization up from 58 to 55 hours. Over.;CDR
32006.6;CDR;Okay. If we don't have a midcourse-3, then we'll probably move LM FAM up to 55 hours, in which case we'll go in there and read SHe tank pressure.;CAPCOM
32018.6;CAPCOM; Roger. Along with the other FAM stuff, and it's not certain that we want to do this, it's just being talked about, so this is just the information for you.;CDR
32034.6;CDR; Okay. This is beginning to sound like the SIM that we ran not too long ago.;CAPCOM
32045.6;CAPCOM; I don't think it will be a very big deal.;CDR

32972.3;CDR;Roger, Joe. We're standing by for that P37 block data if you have it for us.;CAPCOM
32976.3;CAPCOM;"Okay. Got it right here, Jim, and it follows. This is the P37 PAD for lift-off plus 60. The reason for the update is for weather avoidance in the MPL at 119 hours.

33047.3;CAPCOM;"Okay. As of 47 hours; RCS total, 1,096; quad Alpha, 270; Bravo, 278; Charlie, 270; Delta, 278; and the H<sub>2</sub> - They gave me the H<sub>2</sub>s in percent, 76 percent; and on the O<sub>2</sub> we have 81 percent. However, we show the O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 reading off-scale high now. We're quite sure it's a sensor failure. We'd like you to verify it with your onboard reading.";CDR
33093.3;CDR; Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
33111.3;CDR;Joe, we confirm. Our gauge reading is - on the number 2 O<sub>2</sub> tank is reading off-scale high now, but Jack just tells me that it was okay when we first looked at it this morning.;CAPCOM
33124.3;CAPCOM;We verify that. At 46:45 we had 82 percent and apparently when he stirred the, the cryos, the sensor broke.;CDR
33141.3;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
33143.3;CAPCOM;So it's no problem. You're above nominal on all your consumables. On the H<sub>2</sub> tank problem, we have a procedure that we'd like you to carry out which is simply turning the H<sub>2</sub> tank 2 heaters to Off at this time, and we want to see whether that won't solve the problem of the tank pressure setting off caution and warning. We want to look at it that way for a few hours.;CDR
33171.3;CDR;Okay. You want both H<sub>2</sub> tank 2 heaters to Off. Is that correct?;CAPCOM
33175.3;CAPCOM;"That's negative; just tank 2. We want tank 1 to stay in Auto.";CDR
33181.3;CDR;Okay. Tank 2 heaters Off at this time.;CAPCOM
33184.3;CAPCOM;Okay. Good deal. That's been the high tank and apparently while waiting for that pressure switch to close, to start the heater cycle, the tank 1 pressure has been dropping even a little bit lower and just setting off caution and warning, so we feel if we turn off the tank 2 heater and let tank 1 activate the heater cycle, we won't get into the caution and warning range.;CDR
33209.3;CDR; Roger.;CAPCOM
33210.3;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim. At your convenience we'd like P00 and Accept. We're ready for - to uplink your state vector now since we will not do midcourse 3. Over.;CDR
33222.3;CDR;Roger. You're in P00 and Accept, no midcourse 3, and we're all set for a state vector update and I'm giving you the LM/CM Delta-P here shortly.;CAPCOM
33230.3;CAPCOM; Okay. Good deal. And I have Flight Plan updates for you later, at your convenience. [Long pause.];CDR
33262.3;CDR;Houston, Apollo 13. The LM/CM Delta-P is 1.0 psi.;CAPCOM
33267.3;CAPCOM;Copy, 1.0, Jim.;CDR
33341.3;CDR;Houston, Apollo 13. I'm about ready for any Flight Plan updates that you have.;CAPCOM
33344.3;CAPCOM;Okay, 13. To start off with, got a minor procedural change for Jack on his next P52, if he's ready to listen to that.;CDR
33358.3;CDR; Okay. Jack's still off comm. We'll hold off on that a little bit and then we'll pick it up when he gets on comm.;CAPCOM
33365.3;CAPCOM;"Okay; fine. I've got two updates for you, Jim. One is a procedure for looking for Comet Bennett at about 49:45, and I'll wait till Jack gets up before passing you the details on that. The other update is concerned with going into the LM three hours early, and I think Vance mentioned to you last night that this was a possibility, that we'd like to look at the SHe tank pressure early. And since we're not going to do midcourse 3, we'd like LM entry at 55 hours. Is that okay with you?";CDR
33405.3;CDR;Okay. Right, that's fine with us. We'll move up LM entry to 55 hours.;CAPCOM
33412.3;CAPCOM;"Okay. I've got some details on the Flight Plan for you as follows. Of course, since there's no MCC-3, you'll be deleting all the midcourse 3 stuff including the - the P52, which is called out at about 54Â½, and we'll be slipping that until later, which I'll - which I'll tell - which I'll tell - which I'll tell you in a minute. Okay. Then you - we want to move the battery charge up three hours to about 52:30. And we want to move the - moving the LM tunnel vent valve to LM/CM Delta-P up three hours to 52:45, and at that point you can simply go to the 57-hour point in the Flight Plan and change your number from 57 hours to 54 hours and start through that. In the remarks section at about 57:50 it says, 'O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and waste water dump,' here. If not performed earlier, we want you to do that at 54 hours and 50 minutes. The TV pass then, will be at 55 hours to 55:30. You'll go right through the LM Activation checklist stuff. I'm losing you; let's wait a minute. [Long pause.]";CDR
33525.3;CAPCOM;13, Houston. How do you read me? [Long pause.];CDR
33549.3;CAPCOM;13, Houston. You back with us?;CDR
33618.3;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston. Are you back with us?;CDR
33623.3;CDR; We're back with you.;CAPCOM
33624.3;CAPCOM;Okay. I've gone through the battery charge, the LM vent valve, the fuel cell purge, and then stop PTC at 55 hours, and your roll attitude there will be 285 degrees, which is per the Flight Plan. The High Gain Antenna angles are slightly different, pitch 23 and yaw 267 degrees. The TV pass till 55:30, the standard LM activation except for some special steps we'll give you to take a look at SHe tank pressure, which I don't have yet. Restart PTC at about 56:30 or whenever you're through with the LM activities, and after that, at your convenience, we'd like you to - to do the P52 option 3 that we cancelled at 54Â½ hours. Over. [Pause.];CDR
33691.3;CDR;Okay. That last comment was that we'll do the P52 after we start PTC at about 56:30.;CAPCOM
33695.3;CAPCOM;" That's right. Any time after that; it's not time critical. [Pause.]";CDR
33707.3;CDR;Okay. Let's see if I have some of this, Joe. Around 52:30 we're to do the battery charge on Bat - battery B.;CAPCOM
33716.3;CAPCOM; That's correct.;CDR
33718.3;CDR;And then about 52:40 we're going to do the LM tunnel vent valve, and the LM/CM Delta-P which has been written up at 55:40.;CAPCOM
33728.3;CAPCOM; That's correct.;CDR
33733.3;CDR;We're deleting midcourse-3 and we've moved up the LM entry to 55 hours. So we'll merely follow all the - We'll follow all the procedures that leads up to LM entry that was originally scheduled for 58.;CAPCOM
33753.3;CAPCOM;"That's correct. You can start at 57 in the Flight Plan; call it 54 hours and press right on. [Pause.]";CDR
33772.3;CDR;Okay. Then whenever we're finished with the LM, which we anticipate around 56:30, we'll commence PTC and sometime after that we'll do a P52. [Pause.];CAPCOM
33783.3;CAPCOM;That's affirmative. And did you copy the new High Gain angles for 55 hours? The ones we had... [Pause.];CDR
33796.3;CDR;Okay. We're going to stop the PTC for LM entry at roll 285, and High Gain angles are pitch 23 and yaw 267.;CAPCOM
33807.3;CAPCOM;That's correct, Jim. And, 13, Houston. The computer is yours.;CDR
33819.3;CDR; The computer is ours. We're in Block, and exactly when do you want the TV to be cranked up?;CAPCOM

33890.3;CDR;And, Houston, Apollo 13. One thing I missed about the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and waste and water dump.;CAPCOM
33897.3;CAPCOM;Roger. We'd like the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and waste water dump at 54:50.;CDR
33908.3;CDR;Roger. We'll pick up those items at 54:50. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
33934.3;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston.;CMP
33939.3;CMP; Go ahead, Joe.;CAPCOM
33940.3;CAPCOM;All right, Jack. One thing we'd like to have done sometime soon is to have you cycle the cryo fans in O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 one more time. We'd like to see if we can get that sensor back.;LMP
33954.3;LMP;Okay. O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 fan on now.;CAPCOM

34033.3;CAPCOM;Go, 13.;CDR
34038.3;CDR;We - We have just one question, the LM tunnel vent valve. We're questioning why we're venting until the Delta-P is greater than 1.7 if we are going to open up the tunnel, then pressurize the LM usually.;CAPCOM
34051.3;CAPCOM; Right. Stand by on that. [Long pause.];CDR
34075.3;CAPCOM;13, Houston.;CDR
34079.3;CDR; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
34080.3;CAPCOM;Roger. The word on that, Jim, is that they want to ensure the proper O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the LM when you get to the surface, and this is a method of doing that by bleeding out additional nitrogen.;CDR
34096.3;CDR; Okay. Thank you. [Pause.];CAPCOM
34105.3;CAPCOM;And, 13, Houston. If Jack is up, I'd like to talk to him about the P52, briefly.;CDR
34113.3;CDR; Okay. He's here.;CMP
34115.3;CMP; Go ahead, Joe.;CDR
34116.3;CAPCOM;Okay, Jack. What they'd like you to do on this P52 at 49 hours, they've been observing a slight jitter in the optics shaft angle of about 0.2 of a degree plus or minus. Before you come out of the Optics zero position, at the start of this P52, they'd like you to just observe the shaft readout, and see if the jitter occurs on your direct readout there, and also they'd like you to briefly call up a Verb 16, Noun 91 so we can look at the shaft and trunnion angles.;CMP
34155.3;CMP;Okay. Let's see if I got it right. On the P52 at 49 hours, before coming out of zero on the Optics, observe the shaft and also call up 16, 91 and let you look at the shaft and trunnion angles to observe a possible jitter. See whether it occurs in the zero position as well as out of zero.;CAPCOM
34177.3;CAPCOM;" Roger, Jack. That's correct; and if you have time, now, I've got a Flight Plan update for you on looking for the Comet Bennett. [Pause.]";CMP
34194.3;CMP; Okay. Stand by one, Joe. And the commander's going off the air briefly.;CAPCOM
34202.3;CAPCOM; Roger that.;CMP
34266.3;CMP; Okay, Joe. I'm ready to copy the [garble] now.;CAPCOM
34268.3;CAPCOM;Okay, Jack. I'm going to read it to you, and then add some comments and we'll talk about it a little. This should occur sometime after 49:30. After the P52 realign at 49 hours, if time permits, we would like the crew to investigate while in PTC if there is a roll angle in which the comet can be observed for photos. If there is, record the optimum roll angle for possible photography, prior to reinitiating PTC at 56:30 or so, whenever the guys are done in the LM, use P52 planet option, and the following half-unit vectors for tracking Comet Bennett at about 49:46. Are you ready to copy half-unit vectors? Over.;CMP
34329.3;CMP; Okay. Go ahead, Joe.;CAPCOM
34331.3;CAPCOM;"Okay. R1, plus 0.34202; R2, minus 0.07374; R3, plus 0.35719. Read back. [Pause.]";CMP
34357.3;CMP;"Okay. Copy. R1, plus 0.34202; R2, minus 0.07374; R3, plus 0.35719.";CAPCOM
34372.3;CAPCOM;Okay. That's correct and the last sentence on the update is that you can expect AOS of the comet at a roll of 45 degrees and LOS at a roll of 155 degrees. Now, the deal here, Jack, according to the plots they showed me is, the comet appears to be about 10 degrees away from the Sun, and due to the geometry of the LM there shadowing the Sun, it would appear that you will be able to see the comet through the sextant without getting Sun shafting between roll angles of about 45 degrees and 75 degrees. It appears that as your roll gets higher than 75 degrees, although the comet is still in the field of view, the Sun is also in the field of view, and you probably will not have any success between 75 and 155 if you haven't got it from 45 to 75. If you do find that you can see the comet somewhere between 45 and 75 or 80 degrees, just note that roll angle and then if it's feasible we'd like you to photograph it after the LM entry part of the checklist. Over.;CMP
34454.3;CMP;"Okay, Joe. Let me give it back to you and see if I've got it here. After the P52, during our PTC you want us to use P52 and observe Bennett's Comet through the sextant; note a roll angle if we can find it visible. It would be visible somewhere between - ideally between 45 and 75 degrees, and we should lose it about 155 roll, and if we do see it, make an observation of whether it is photographable, note the roll angle for photographs to be taken after or prior to initiation of PTC at 56:30.";CAPCOM
34502.3;CAPCOM; That's exactly right, Jack.;CMP
34508.3;CMP; Okay. Real fine.;CAPCOM
34644.3;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston.;CMP
34648.3;CMP; Go ahead, Joe.;CAPCOM
34649.3;CAPCOM;We're ready to have to O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 fan off, and thank you.;CMP

34774.5;CAPCOM;13 Houston. Jack, could you give us a readout on your counter now?;CMP
34783.5;CMP;Okay. I'm showing a shaft of 0.2 and a trunnion of 359.92.;CAPCOM
34796.5;CAPCOM; Roger. Copy that. Is there any jumping around on the shaft?;CMP
34805.5;CMP; You mean on the TPAC readout?;CAPCOM
34807.5;CAPCOM; Yes.;CMP
34810.5;CMP;As a matter of fact, it went from 0.2 to 0.21.;CAPCOM

35179.9;CMP;"Hey, Houston; 13.";CAPCOM
35181.9;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Go ahead.;CMP
35185.9;CMP;Okay, Joe. I got into P52 about 49:34. We loaded the planet - or Bennett Comet vectors into the planet option, and P52 tracked it all the way across except that it was always occulted by the LM, and we're in a roll angle of 155 now.;CAPCOM
35210.9;CAPCOM; Roger. We're copying your roll angles. At what roll angle were you able to start tracking it, Jack? [Pause.];CMP
35225.9;CMP;Okay. At the time we entered it there, we were about 66 degrees roll, so either we started too late, or maybe somehow we got a wrong calculation on the roll angle.;CAPCOM
35241.9;CAPCOM;"Okay. Let me have G&amp;C comment on that. I suspect that the roll angles we gave you were calculated for exactly 90 degrees pitch, and you're probably wobbling enough that they're not exactly correct.";CDR

And if there are, and we have time, we might give it another try; if not, we just will forget it.";CMP

35613.9;CMP; Okay, Joe. Do we have you back again?;CAPCOM
35616.9;CAPCOM;"Okay, Jack. We're getting you back, and I hope you copied my - my correction of my mistake. I'm talking about the H<sub>2</sub> Cryo Tanks. We'd like the tank 1 Heater to Off; tank 2 to Auto. Over.";CMP
35630.9;CMP;"Okay. We lost you again. Here's our heater configuration now. H<sub>2</sub> Heaters 1, Off; 2, Auto. Both O<sub>2</sub> Heaters are in Auto. [Long pause.]";CAPCOM
35644.9;CAPCOM;"Okay. That's the configuration we want you in, and here's what we're thinking about. When we went to tank 1 Auto, tank 2 Off; we found that the heater cycle had a tank 1 pressure of about 233 psi, which is well above the caution and warning limit, and if we go to that configuration for sleep, we'll keep from getting Caution and Warning lights during the sleep cycle. Okay. In order to do that comfortably, we want to spend the rest of the day using more H<sub>2</sub> out of tank number 2, so as to get an unbalance in favor of tank 1, so at the end of the sleep cycle it'll all come out even. And that's why we have you in tank 1 Off, tank 2 Auto, now. We expect to get about a 3-percent unbalance over the next 10 hours; and prior to sleep, we'll call you to reverse the configuration again. Now the only disadvantage here is that, during the day, you will probably get a few Caution and Warnings, and we just figured it would be better to get them now than while you were sacked out. Over.";CMP
35716.9;CDR;I'll buy that 100 percent.;CAPCOM
35718.9;CAPCOM;"Okay. Good deal. One other detail for you, Jack; G&amp;C tells us that the Optics jitter is very similar to what we had on Apollo 12.

35912.1;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
35913.1;CAPCOM;Roger, Jim. If you've got a couple of minutes now, I'd like to read up to you the change to the LM entry procedure that we'd like you to observe at 55 hours, and the rationale for it. Over.;CDR
35932.1;CDR; Okay, Stand by.;CAPCOM
35935.1;CAPCOM; Roger.;CDR
35941.1;CDR; Go ahead, Joe.;CAPCOM
35943.1;CAPCOM;Okay. Before you start copying, this procedure is - is basically simply to activate the supercritical helium pressure gauging so that you can read it. And the concern here is lest this supercritical helium pressure reach 1800 psi by 103 hours, at which point we'd be within a possibility of rupturing the burst disk when you activate the DPS. Now, based on the pressure at launch, and based on a nominal rise time of about 6Â½ psi per hour between then and now, the pressure should read about 710 psi. Stand by, 13, until we get better comm. [Long pause.];CDR
36021.1;CDR; Houston, you were cut out. Would you say again about the helium pressure.;CAPCOM
36027.1;CAPCOM;Roger. Based on the prelaunch pressure in the SHe tank and the nominal rise time of about 6Â½ psi per hour, the pressure should be about 710 at 55 hours. Are you reading? Over. [Pause.];LMP
36054.1;CAPCOM; Jim, Houston. Did you read that last?;LMP
36141.1;LMP; Okay, Joe. I'm on Omni C now. How do you read?;CAPCOM
36145.1;CAPCOM;13, Houston. You're loud and clear now. INCO tells me he's having a little problem at Goldstone and wants me to stand by for a minute. [Pause.];LMP
36160.1;LMP; Okay. How do you read now, Joe? I'm going from Omni C to D now.;CAPCOM
36164.1;CAPCOM; You're still loud and clear on - on D, Fred. Stand by one.;LMP
36172.1;LMP; Okay. I'll put her back to Omni B if you all want to take command again? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
36207.1;LMP;And the last thing we heard, Joe, was that the Supercrit should be reading about 710 psi.;CAPCOM
36214.1;CAPCOM;"Okay. That's the last thing I passed up. And while we're waiting for INCO to decide here, let me continue. The dead band that is considered acceptable is between 660 and 770 psi. In other words, any rise time that'll give you one - a pressure between those two, will keep you below the critical pressure at 103 hours or so. So, we expect it to read in that - in that band and if it does, there will be no problem. If it reads between 770 and 800 psi, we will want you to check the pressure again at about 59 hours, and I'll get the detailed procedures in a minute. If the pressure is equal to or greater than 800 psi, we're going to have to go into some more detailed procedures; we're going to try to - to get PCM data on it, for one thing. We may have to have you sit there and stare at the gauge for a while to find out when it clicks up and get an accurate rise time on it, and then in extreme case, we are even thinking about a DPS burn, but we don't really think that will happen. Now, if you are ready to copy, what I have for you is a change or an addition to the LM Activation checklist between pages TLC-1 and TLC-2, which consists of seven steps, and if you can find a blank side to write it down on, I would like to pass it up. Over. [Long pause.]";LMP
36322.1;LMP; Okay. How do you read on Omni C, now?;CAPCOM
36326.1;CAPCOM; Okay. You're loud and clear on Omni C. Stand by one while we get INCO synced up. [Pause.];LMP
36338.1;LMP;"Okay. The rest of your update was that it's okay if it is anywhere between 660 and 770 psi. If it's above 770, you are going to ask us to consider going back in at 59 hours and either get PCM going or sit there and give you gauge reading changes on the basis of that. And you said something about an extreme measure; we may have to consider some sort of DPS maneuver.";CAPCOM
36383.1;CAPCOM;That's correct, Fred. We don't have procedures for that yet, and we don't have any real expectation of getting into it. The procedure I'd like to read up to you now is simply the steps required to get the supercritical helium pressure reading, at 55 hours. Over.;LMP
36408.1;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
36410.1;CAPCOM;Okay. We're calling this TLC1-A, step 6, 'Transfer to LM power.';LMP

36726.1;LMP; I'm going to stay Omni B, if you all want to take command back and you can let INCO jockey them around between B and D. And how many steps we got, so I know whether to write big or small here, Joe?;CAPCOM
36739.1;CAPCOM;Okay. We got steps 6 through 12, but step 7 is the same size as 6, and 8 through 12 are short. They're only one line each.;LMP

37142.1;LMP;Okay. Configure - step 10, 'Configure circuit breakers per Activation pages 3 and 4.';CAPCOM
37149.1;CAPCOM;Roger. That's correct. Step 11 is, 'Deactivate the utility lights if you activated them,' and step 12 which is the last one is, 'Transfer to CSM power, usual observations, and report time to MCC.' [Long pause.];LMP

37209.1;CAPCOM;Okay. That's it. And, of course, Houston will be requesting you to go to step 9 if the pressure is less than 770. If the pressure is between 770 and 800, we will be asking you to do the following, if you're ready to copy. [Pause.];LMP
37237.1;LMP; Stand by. I've got to find some more blank paper.;CAPCOM
37239.1;CAPCOM;Yes. This is going to be page TLC-3, but it's very short. [Long pause.];LMP

37323.1;LMP; All right. Go ahead.;CAPCOM
37324.1;CAPCOM;Roger. We'll hold off on that. It was a short three-step procedure which said, 'Repeat activation pages 1, 1A, and 2,' but there was another step in it that nobody understands. So, essentially what we'd recommend in that case would be that you would repeat the procedure that we just passed up for reading the Supercrit pressure. If we need to, we'll clarify it later on. And that's all we've got.;LMP
37354.1;LMP; Okay.;CDR
37372.3;CDR;Houston, 13.;CAPCOM
37378.3;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Go ahead.;CDR
37383.3;CDR;"Okay. One thing, Joe; I just want to double check again. All the stuff that normally was going to start at 57 hours, which the first item was pressurize CSM to 5.7 psia, we're going to move that up to 54 now, so we have our LM entry which was nominally at 58 at 55. Is that correct?";CAPCOM
37404.3;CAPCOM; That's correct, Jim.;CDR
37406.3;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
37416.7;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston.;CDR
37421.7;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
37422.7;CAPCOM;Roger, 13. Because of the O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 quantity sensor drop out, EECOM wants to keep a little closer track of the cryo quantities, and he's going to be asking you to stir all the cryo tanks at slightly more frequent intervals than had been planned, and the first time is now, and we will be calling you probably every 5 or 6 hours, except during sleep period and high activity periods. We'd like you to do it now. Over.;CDR
37458.7;CDR; Okay. We'll start it [garble] now.;CAPCOM
37460.7;CAPCOM; Thank you. [Long pause.];CDR
37473.7;CAPCOM;And, 13, Houston. For your information, a normal 1-minute or so stir will be fine.;CDR
37485.1;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston.;CDR
37491.1;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
37493.1;CAPCOM;"Jim, just an advisory; expect a Caution and Warning on H<sub>2</sub> tank 1 pretty quick. No problems; just warning you about it.";CDR
37507.1;CDR;Okay. A zero pressure light on H<sub>2</sub> tank 1 coming on shortly, huh?;CAPCOM
37511.1;CAPCOM; Right.;CDR
37514.1;CDR; Okay. Well, you're pretty close. It just came on. [Pause.];CAPCOM
37523.1;CAPCOM; Any other predictions you'd like?;CDR
37529.1;CDR; Well, there's - I guess there's all sorts. Could you go to the horse races with me?;CAPCOM
37535.1;CAPCOM;" I'm sorry; you were garbled. Say again?";CDR
37540.1;CDR; I said I'd like to invite you to the horse races with me.;CAPCOM
37544.1;CAPCOM; Right. We'll - We'll send EECOM.;LMP
37550.1;LMP; Well, it's time for a little grits again here, Vance.;CAPCOM
37556.1;CAPCOM; Understand. Some grits, huh? Chow. Bon appetite.;LMP
37561.5;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston.;CDR
37566.5;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
37568.5;CAPCOM; Roger. Just expect that same Caution and Warning to come on again. And you want us to keep warning you of that thing? [Pause.];CDR
37584.5;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
37588.5;CAPCOM; Roger, Jim. Just expect a Caution and Warning to come on the same as it did about an hour ago. [Pause.];CDR

37634.5;CDR;Houston, Apollo 13.;CAPCOM
37637.5;CAPCOM;13, Houston. How do you read now?;CDR
37642.5;CDR; Okay. Read you good now. Seems like we've had a little trouble with the comm today.;CAPCOM
37647.5;CAPCOM; Yes. I guess it's partly because you are further out. We just wanted to tell you that you were going to get that Caution Warning that you just got.;CDR
37659.5;CDR; Right. We just got.;CAPCOM
37661.5;CAPCOM; And I won't bother you with those calls anymore, unless you especially want them.;CDR
37671.5;CDR; That's okay, Vance. You don't have to call us about that, unless it's something serious.;CAPCOM
37675.5;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];CDR
37693.5;LMP; We just ate a can of ham salad and that was an experience.;CAPCOM
37701.5;CAPCOM; Roger. Copy. [Pause.];LMP

37764.3;CAPCOM;13, Houston. Go ahead.;CDR
37769.3;CDR;Right, we're not doing anything right now, Vance, we're just getting curious, we could start the LM entry procedures, and get everything squared away, and then when the TV comes up at 55 hours, we can just use it for the TV, and we wouldn't be worrying about checking out the SHe tank pressures and everything like that.;CAPCOM
37791.3;CAPCOM; Okay, let us mull that one a minute here, and I'll get right back with you.;CDR
37798.3;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
37807.5;CDR;Also, Houston, Apollo 13. We'd like to move up the waste water dump and maybe the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge a little bit early, if we could. [Pause.];CAPCOM
37823.5;CAPCOM; Okay, stand by.;CDR
37982.5;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston.;CDR
37987.5;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
37989.5;CAPCOM;Jim, you're clear to go on into the LM, and just advise though that the TV time is still fixed at 55 hours, and - so we'll be standing by to support your entry and we'll get back with you on a minute - in a minute on the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and the waste water dump.;CDR
38011.5;CDR; Okay. Sounds good.;CAPCOM
38014.5;CAPCOM;And also request your LM/CM Delta-P which was on the Flight Plan for 53 hours. What did you vent it down to? Over. [Pause.];CDR
38028.5;CDR;We have 1.7 now. We vented it down to that figure.;CAPCOM
38032.5;CAPCOM;Okay, you vented down to 1.7, and what did it start at?;CDR
38040.5;CDR;It was about 1.1, Vance.;CAPCOM

38070.9;CAPCOM;We're reading 4.3, Fred.;LMP
38076.9;LMP; Okay.;CDR
38083.6;CDR;Houston, 13.;CAPCOM
38088.6;CAPCOM;Go ahead, Apollo 13.;CDR
38092.6;CDR;We'd like another confirmation, when we closed the tunnel vent valve back to LM/CM Delta-P, we were reading about 1.7 - 1.75, and it slowly went up now to about - oh, I'd say a little less than 2.2. Seems to be holding there - Is there a lag in the gauging system?;CAPCOM
38118.6;CAPCOM; Okay. We'll - we'll ask that question. Stand by.;CDR

38295.6;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
38297.6;CAPCOM; Okay, to answer your question, Jim, that increase in pressure is normal, because it was just tracking an increase in cabin pressure.;CDR
38311.6;CDR; Okay. Okay.;CAPCOM
38322.6;CDR; We're not thinking today. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
38345.6;CAPCOM;And, 13, from Houston, it's okay with us if you want to move the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and the water dump up to this time. Over.;CDR

38953.4;CAPCOM; Fred, Houston is reading you loud and clear.;LMP
38958.4;LMP;Okay. I've got up through step 7 now, and I'm not getting much of a light in the helium indicator here. Why don't I review for you how we've proceeded, and you look at the procedure you gave me, and see if we've missed anything.;CAPCOM

39050.4;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred, let us take a look at it.;LMP
39051.4;LMP; I was wondering, do we need an A - do we need, possibly, in the - one of the Anun/Dock/Component breakers in?;CAPCOM
39062.4;CAPCOM; Stand by one. [Long pause.];LMP
39077.4;LMP;Okay, Jack. Hold the phone. I forgot the rheostat was cranked all the way down on the Anun/Num and it's showing 720, which looks like a pretty good - pretty good number.;CAPCOM
39091.4;CAPCOM;Roger. We copy 720. Thank you, Fred...;LMP
39093.4;LMP;Flashed to 7 - Okay, and it just flickered down to 710. It's kind of flickering between 710 and 720.;CAPCOM
39104.4;CAPCOM;Roger. 710 to 720. [Pause.];LMP
39120.4;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. Those are good numbers, and we're not going to have to crank up the TM. That's the number we were looking for.;LMP
39130.4;LMP; Very good. Okay. Do you want me to back out of this in reverse at least as far as getting this part of it powered down?;CAPCOM
39140.4;CAPCOM; Stand by one. [Long pause.];LMP
39160.4;CAPCOM; Fred, this is Houston. Go ahead and back out of this little test and proceed.;LMP
39168.4;LMP; Roger.;CMP
39181.2;CMP;Okay. We're back on CSM power. The time was 54 hours, 58 minutes, 50 seconds.;LMP
39190.2;CAPCOM;Roger, Jack. 54:58:50. Thank you. [Pause.];CMP
39206.2;CMP; Okay, Houston, we'll try to pick you up on the High Gain.;CAPCOM

39263.2;CAPCOM;13, we're ready on the TV when you are. Any time.;CDR
39268.2;CDR; Okay, sounds good. With you in a minute, we're just cranking up High Gain now. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
39320.2;CDR; Okay, Houston. How do you read us in the High Gain?;CAPCOM
39323.2;CAPCOM;We're hearing you 5 square, Jim, how me?;CDR
39328.2;CDR; Okay. You're coming through okay. [Pause.];CAPCOM
39340.2;CAPCOM; As you were on that, Jim. We don't have you on High Gain yet. We're still looking at you. [Long pause.];CDR
39387.2;CAPCOM;13, Houston. In this attitude, we'd suggest pitch 5, yaw 237 on the High Gain. Over.;CDR
39399.2;CDR;Pitch 5, yaw 237. Roger.;CMP
39552.2;CMP; Okay, Jack. Can you - can you read the High Gain now? [Pause.];CDR
39564.2;CAPCOM; Affirmative, Jack. We've got you on a High Gain and it appears to us that we're in Wide beam - Wide beam width.;CMP
39572.2;CMP;Yes. We can't get it to come down to Narrow. We tried to switch to Auto Track or Reacq, and it - yaw drives around from 270 to 0. And pitch goes from about 6 degrees around to 90. I'm trying - we're fitting it manual now at the angles that you gave us, and I'll try and get you in Medium and Narrow beam width picking it up manually here.;CAPCOM
39606.2;CAPCOM; Roger, Jack. Meanwhile, we'll look at the situation you describe there.;CMP
39613.2;CMP; Okay. And it does it on both sets of servo electronic power. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
39675.2;CMP;Jack, what it looks like is that, when we hit 239 degrees at this attitude, it hit some sort of scan limit or something and drops off. [Pause.];CAPCOM
39693.2;CAPCOM;" Roger, Jack; thank you.";CMP
39697.2;CMP; Okay, I'm trying you in Wide or Medium beam width now. [Pause.];CAPCOM
39714.2;CMP; Can you pick up the TV in this condition here at all? [Pause.];CAPCOM
39727.2;CAPCOM; Negative, Jack. We'll have to have the Narrow beam width.;CMP
39734.2;CMP; Okay. Can you give us, maybe, a slight maneuver? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
39789.2;CAPCOM;Jack, we'd like you to check two High Gain circuit breakers down in panel 25. Check your High Gain group 2 and your High Gain in the flight bus. Over.;CMP
39799.2;CMP; Okay. Okay, Jack, they're both In.;CAPCOM
39807.2;CAPCOM; Roger.;CMP
39883.2;CAPCOM;13, we've got an attitude suggestion for you. We suggest that you go to roll 285 and try pitch 90 and yaw 0. Over.;CMP
39897.2;CMP; Okay.;CDR
39929.8;CDR;"Okay, Houston; Apollo 13. I think we've got High Gain locked up now. Do you confirm?";CAPCOM
39936.8;CAPCOM; We confirm that, Jim, we've got you locked up on the High Gain and narrow beam.;CDR
39942.8;CDR; Okay, sounds good. We'll get the TV started right away.;CAPCOM
39945.8;CAPCOM; Roger. [Long pause.];CDR
39965.8;CAPCOM;"13, Houston. We'd like to disable Quads C and D; use Alpha and Bravo. Over. [Pause.]";CMP
39973.8;CMP; Okay... [Long pause.];CDR
39974.8;CDR; ...Disable quads C and D. Roger.;CMP
39985.8;CAPCOM;Okay, 13. We've got Freddo on TV.;CDR
39993.8;CDR; Roger, Houston. What we plan to do for you today is start out in the space shipper [sic] Odyssey, and take you on through from Odyssey in through the tunnel into Aquarius. And show you a little bit of the landing vehicle, and your TV operator is now resting on the center couch, looking at Fred Haise, whose head is now just about at the beginning of the tunnel, and his back is against the Lower Equipment Bay optical area. And Fred will now transport himself into the tunnel, and into the spaceship Aquarius.;CAPCOM
40037.8;LMP; You know one thing I noted, Jack, when I first came across here, that starting upright in the Command Module and heading down in Aquarius, there's a little bit of an orientation change that, even though I'd been through it once in the water tank, it still pretty unusual. I find myself, now, standing with my head on the floor when I get down inside the LM. [Pause.];CAPCOM
40074.8;CAPCOM; That's a great picture, Jim. You got the light just right. [Pause.];LMP
40089.8;LMP;And one of the nice things, Jack, particularly for a novice like myself, is the - the ease of moving around in here. It's, of course, as you know from working in the Command Module Simulator, it's really quite a boon to have zero gravity as an aid. Because you get - pretty confining, really, at one g, to move around very much in there, and it's quite easy in this environment. The LM, as you can see, it looked pretty clean, I found a couple of loose washers about it and the - a little plastic cap off the sequence camera had come loose and I found it lodged over by the ED panel. Okay. Right under Jim, now, he's actually standing on a - what looks to be a can here. And, for the sake of all the people back there, housed inside this can is the - the LM ascent engine where, hopefully, you can see my hand resting on top of right now - the engine that we use to get off of the Moon. Immediately adjacent to the engine cover here, I have my hand on a white box now, which has been shown before. This happens to be Jim's PLSS, or the backpack which'll supply oxygen and water for cooling while on the lunar surface. This device we hope to make use of for - a planned 4 hours and possibly up to as much as 5 hours. Right - right behind the PLSS, a couple of little square packages I now have my hand on here, one here and one right below, are our OPSs, which are, in essence, the emergency oxygen supplies, which are good for some 40 to 45 minutes. These are - when we get ready to mount up and head outside, will be placed up on top of the PLSS. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
40253.8;LMP; The second backpack is mounted down on the LM floor, I hope, positioned right between the two of us. I have my hand on it at this time.;CAPCOM
40270.8;CAPCOM; Roger, Fred. We see it. The picture's coming through real good, and your description is good. We see Jim's got the camera oriented the way we like to look at it. So, keep talking. [Pause.];LMP
40294.8;LMP; Okay. I guess everybody has pretty much envisioned the space program as being all a lot of exotic electronics, and, certainly, a lot of it is. But I thought I'd bring out a couple of items here in conjunction with the PLSS. After the first EVA, you get a very accurate measurement of the amount of water that's left in the PLSSs. We're going to make use of this bag I'm showing now to collect the remaining water out of the PLSS and see just how much we really did have left, and hopefully, on future missions, to be able to extend safely the allowable time on these units even a little further. And, my other hand, I have the mechanism by which we determine just how much water we really have in this bag. And I guess this - an apt description for this device would be a fish scale. And you can see I'm weighing myself right now, and it says I weigh actually less than zero right now. Guess its calibration isn't too good.;CAPCOM
40371.8;CAPCOM; That'll be the day. [Pause.];LMP
40378.8;LMP; I think even you'd weigh zero here, Jack. [Pause.];CAPCOM
40387.8;CAPCOM; TouchÃ© [Long pause.].;CDR
40423.8;CDR; Houston, this is Jim. Since Fred's been in the Lunar Module, and since he's the Lunar Module Pilot, this is the first time that he's felt that he's been right-side up. [Pause.];CAPCOM
40443.8;CAPCOM; Roger, Jim.;CDR
40446.8;CDR;" I might tell you that we're looking at right now, that round bag that's just behind Fred holds our vacuum hose; and when we get back inside the LM, we'll hook the vacuum off our suits, and it's resting or it's attached to the hatch which will - we will open to go on to the lunar surface, and, of course, to come back in. The hatch which we have come to now is a round hatch, which is our docking hatch between the - between Odyssey and Aquarius.";CAPCOM
40480.8;CAPCOM; Roger, and we see Fred looking in the vacuum cleaner there now. [Pause.];CMP
40491.8;LMP; Okay, what I have out now, Jack, is LEVA, which has also been shown before. It's a head garment for wearing out on the surface, and I - I'm bringing Jim's out here to show a couple of mods [modifications]. One problem before is that the cast of characters down on the surface haven't been able to be distinguished apart very well. So, not only Jim's suit has some red stripes on it, but as you can see his LEVA also has a - a red stripe. [Long pause.];CMP
40556.8;LMP;And now you can see one other mod here too, Jack, which I hadn't really seen myself before. I guess on 12, Pete and Al had commented about the - commented about having trouble with sunlight in the eyes, so on our LEVAs they put on a new center section which you can pull down and use sort of like a baseball cap.;CDR
40585.8;CDR; Okay, Jack. Who fixed up our LEVAs? [Long pause.];LMP
40601.8;LMP; How's the detail on this one, Jack?;CAPCOM
40604.8;CAPCOM; Say again, Fred.;LMP
40608.8;LMP; Can you see any detail in this picture now, or am I blocking out too much of the sunlight?;CAPCOM
40615.8;CAPCOM; That's affirmative. We've got a good picture of the LEVA there, and it's coming through loud and clear.;LMP
40624.8;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CDR
40643.8;CDR; Okay, Jack, while Fred is putting away my helmet, you are looking over into Fred's station now. How's this picture, is it okay before - or do I have to adjust it?;LMP
40655.8;CAPCOM; We have a hunch that the setting might be in Peak but we recommend Average on the ALC if you haven't got it there already.;CDR
40665.8;CDR; We're in Average, Jack.;CAPCOM
40667.8;CAPCOM; Okay. And we're getting a good picture of the LMP side with the DEDA over there. [Pause.];CMP
40678.8;CMP; Hey, Jack, one question on the Command Module here. Do I - I have the DAP right now wide deadband. Do you want me to begin setting up narrow dead band and nulling the rates to start PTC again. [Pause.];CAPCOM
40696.8;CAPCOM; Stand by, Jack. [Long pause.];LMP
40740.8;LMP;What I'm fishing out now, Jack, is another new piece of hardware that we are taking along this time as a result of some comments made on the Apollo 12 flight. [Pause.];CAPCOM
40761.8;CDR;What Fred is opening up - is a drink bag that we place inside of our neckring that will allow us to drink while we are on the lunar surface. They - Pete and Al - did not have that on Apollo 12 and they, consequently, got very thirsty. But we hope to alleviate that situation by having our own little bag of water which, with very little effort, we can have a sip or two while we are looking around and doing our geology work. [Pause.];LMP
40802.8;LMP; So if you hear any funny noises, it is just probably the drink bag. [Pause.];CDR
40819.8;CDR; Fred, the bag's empty. [Long pause.];LMP
40845.8;CDR; Fred is now looking through our optical device. It's an instrument in which to align our platform, and Fred is now looking into it just to see what kind of an outside picture he might be able to get. We might be able to use a TV camera to look through our optical instrument to the outside of the Command Module. A few minutes ago while we first came in, we did manage to look to the outside of the side hatch of the Command Module through our optical instrument. Stand by. We'll try to see what we can do here.;LMP
40878.8;CAPCOM; Roger, Jim. Break, Jack, we'd like you to stay in the dead band you are now in, and we'll make a change when the TV is over. Another thing we would like you to do is check your pitch and yaw on your High Gain meter so we can compare it with what we're seeing down here. [Pause.];CMP
40900.8;CMP;Okay, it's showing about - say 28 degrees and 267.;CAPCOM
40907.8;CAPCOM;20 and 267.;CMP
40910.8;CMP;28 - 28 and 267. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
40934.8;LMP; Okay, Jack, Have you got that picture now?;CAPCOM
40938.8;CAPCOM; Fred, about one-quarter of our screen is lighted, and it's impossible to determine what you are looking at right now. Maybe you could give us a little verbal description.;LMP
40951.8;LMP;Okay. It's looking through the AOT in position 4, right rear. And we're looking back toward the ... over the side hatch at the aft side of the service module. [Pause.];CDR
40977.8;LMP; Okay. Is - is it too dark a picture, Jack? You think the f-stop open may help?;CDR
40983.8;CAPCOM; No, Fred, it's got to be centered up a little bit. That's primarily what you have to do.;CDR
40992.8;CDR; Jack, we can't center it up any more, because the side hatch is only one part of the AOT. The rest of that blackness you see is really space. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
41020.8;LMP;Okay. We'll try another one, and it's a little better centered. In fact, the only other one we have that shows the whole picture. We're in the forward detent of the AOT now, position 2, and you should be seeing something familiar like a radar antenna. [Pause.];CAPCOM
41050.8;CAPCOM; Okay, we see you moving the camera up to the AOT lens, and we got a real good picture now. [Long pause.];LMP
41072.8;CDR; And... [Long pause.];LMP
41092.8;LMP; Okay, Jack, I'm looking out the right window now, and not too far off in the distance now, you can see the objective, and I'll zoom in on it here a little and see if it brings it in better. [Long pause.];CDR
41126.8;LMP; And it's actually beginning to look a little bigger now. You can see quite distinctly some of the features with the naked eye. And so far, I guess I have to even agree with Jim that it's still looking pretty gray with white spots. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
41168.8;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. We're getting a good picture of your destination there. [Long pause.];LMP
41193.8;CDR; Jack, you've been looking at the - at Fred's workshop now, and you can see the abort guidance computer. And over there on the - tucked away in his armrest, is our activation checklist, which we'll be using very shortly. Up on the top of the window, we have our camera already mounted ready for photographing the descent. And now Fred's engaged in his favorite pastime, I found out on this flight so far. [Pause.];CAPCOM
41236.8;CAPCOM; He's not in the food locker, is he?;CDR
41241.8;CDR; That's his second favorite pastime. He's rigging his hammock for sleep on the lunar surface now to find out - to see what it's going to be like.;CAPCOM
41252.8;CAPCOM; Roger. Sleeping and then eating. [Long pause.];CDR
41278.8;LMP; It's kind of difficult here, Jack, getting into a hammock in zero g. I'm not sure if I keep floating away from it or it keeps moving away from me. [Pause.];CDR
41299.8;CDR; If you notice a few things floating around, we found just about one or two washers occasionally.;LMP
41306.8;LMP; And for the benefit of those that may wonder where Jim sleeps. Be a little difficult to rig his hammock in here right now with the hatch open, but his runs laterally in this direction, fore-aft. So he has the upper berth and I get the lower berth. [Long pause.];CDR
41343.8;CDR;And now while Fred's taking his hammock down and restowing it, I might give you some idea of what sort of confusion of attitudes since there is no up or down, and I'm situated on top of the ascent engine just at the entrance to the tunnel. I'll reverse the camera 180 degrees and go from Fred, look through the tunnel again back at Odyssey, and we might pick up part of Jack. [Long pause.];LMP
41394.8;CAPCOM; There he is. We see him. [Long pause.];CDR
41425.8;CDR; Okay, Houston. For the benefit of the television viewers, we've just about completed our little inspection of Aquarius, and now we're proceeding through the hatchy-gap into the tunnel and going back toward the Odyssey. [Pause.];CAPCOM
41451.8;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. It's been a great show so far. [Long pause.];CDR
41509.8;CDR; And finally, Jack's let me back into the Odyssey as we slide on through the tunnel here. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
41563.8;CDR;Houston, 13. Are you still on TV?;CAPCOM
41566.8;CAPCOM; Yes, we sure are. We've got a good picture of the skipper there.;CDR
41571.8;CDR; Okay. What we can show you now, a little added benefit, we've got the drogue on Fred's couch in the Command Module right now, we stowed it temporarily while we're checking out the - out Aquarius and underneath his couch, we've got the probes stowed. Quite a big cumbersome device, and we'll get a shot of it for you. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
41622.8;CDR; You're looking now at our probe, the place on the nose of Odyssey. It's a very heavy thing but I suppose in zero gravity it weighs nothing, and it's much easier to move around. As a matter of fact, both Fred and Jack commented, as many people in the past have, of how much bigger the spacecraft appears in actual flight when you have such ease in moving compared to our simulator which make training rather difficult. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
41667.8;CAPCOM; Okay. We're seeing a good picture of the probe there, Jim, and looks like the characters shaved before the show this time.;CDR
41679.8;CDR; Well, Fred said he had to keep up his TV image.;CAPCOM
41686.8;LMP; Yes. That may be my first and last time though, Jack.;CAPCOM
41690.8;CDR; It took Fred one hour to shave. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
41706.8;CDR; We might give you a quick - a quick shot of our entertainment on board the spacecraft, which has been keeping us company for some time. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
41744.8;CDR;This little tape recorder has been a big benefit - has been a big benefit to us in passing some of our time away on our transit to the Moon, and it's rather odd to see it floating like this in Odyssey while it's playing the theme from '2001'. And, of course, the tapes wouldn't be complete without 'Aquarius'. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
41797.8;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. We're seeing the tape recorder now, and just - by the way, how long do you expect to keep the TV on this evening?;CDR
41807.8;CDR; Well, when we - Stand by one.;CAPCOM
41814.8;LMP; Yes, I got them with the cabin repress valve again there, Jack.;CDR
41818.8;CDR; Every time he does that our hearts - our hearts jump in our mouth. And, Jack, any time you want to terminate TV, we're all set to go. [Long pause.];LMP
41850.8;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. It's been a real good TV show. We think we ought to conclude it from here now. What do you think?;CDR
41860.8;CDR;Roger. Sounds good. And this is the crew of Apollo 13 wishing everybody there a,nice evening, and we're just about ready to close out our inspection of,Aquarius and get back for a pleasant evening in Odyssey. Good night.;CAPCOM
41879.8;CAPCOM;Thank you, 13.;CMP
41895.8;CAPCOM;Okay FLIGHT, you read his pitch and yaw and his high-gain meter.;FLIGHT
41899.8;FLIGHT;That's affirmative.;CAPCOM
41900.8;CAPCOM;And now you want roll right to 060?;FLIGHT
41904.8;FLIGHT;Might as well do that. And we'll try and get Comet Bennett, I'd still like the,verification on the docking angle because that's what we'll be using for,computation for alignments and everything else. Let's see if there's anything,else.;CAPCOM
41916.8;EECOM;FLIGHT, EECOM.;FLIGHT
41917.8;FLIGHT;Go ahead, EECOM.;EECOM
41918.8;EECOM;Okay, let's terminate the battery B charge at 55 +50.;FLIGHT
41923.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;EECOM
41924.8;EECOM;And at the same time, I'd sure like to have a cryo stir, all 4 tanks.;FLIGHT
41929.8;FLIGHT;Let's wait until they get settled down a little more.;EECOM
41931.8;EECOM;Roger.;FLIGHT
41932.8;GNC;FLIGHT, GNC.;FLIGHT
41933.8;FLIGHT;Go, GNC.;GNC
41934.8;GNC;They would still like to enable the other two quads for the maneuver.;FLIGHT
41938.8;FLIGHT;Okay. When rolling to 060 you want them to enable C and D, right?;GNC
41944.8;GNC;Right.;FLIGHT
41945.8;FLIGHT;Do you want them to disable A and B?;GNC
41947.8;GNC;No.;FLIGHT
41948.8;FLIGHT;Okay. All four quads.;GNC
41949.8;GNC;They have a coupled jet maneuver -;FLIGHT
41950.8;FLIGHT;Roger. Copy, CAPCOM?;CAPCOM
41953.8;CAPCOM;Got it.;FLIGHT
41954.8;INCO;FLIGHT, INCO.;FLIGHT
41955.8;FLIGHT;Go, INCO.;INCO
41956.8;INCO;I'd like to confirm their configuration on their high-gain now.;FLIGHT
41959.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;INCO
41960.8;INCO;I'd like to know what track mode they're in and what SERVO electronics they're,in.;FLIGHT
41965.8;FLIGHT;Okay, let's just standby 1 there. Now we'll C and D for roll to 060, terminate,battery B charge.;INCO
41979.8;FLIGHT;Okay, the third thing we want up there, CAPCOM, is to verify their high-gain,configuration. And I assume what you want from there is you want to know their,tracking, position of track - BEAM WIDTH you don't need, do you? Do you want,the whole works?;INCO
41994.8;INCO;Yeah, the whole works.;FLIGHT
41995.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;INCO
42000.8;FLIGHT;CAPCOM, we want the configuration of the CSM high-gain.;CAPCOM
42009.8;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston. The next thing we'd like you to do is to -;CMP
42014.8;CMP;Go ahead.;CAPCOM
42015.8;CAPCOM;- we'd like you to roll right to 060 and null your rates for photography of the,Comet Bennett. To do that, we would like you to enable quads C and D. For the,maneuver, use all your quads. And in precisely 1 minute, we'd like you to,terminate the battery charge on battery B. One other request, we'd like to have,you verify -;CMP
42042.8;CMP;Okay. Will do.;CAPCOM
42043.8;CAPCOM;One other request, we'd like you to verify your high gain configuration. We'd,like to know what track mode, what SERVO, and what BEAM WIDTH.;CMP
42054.8;CMP;Okay, Jack. During the TV we were AUTO TRACK, NARROW BEAM WIDTH, and the,PRIMARY ELECTRONICS. And we had a good lockup. Just after we started the,maneuver, I was able to lock you up and get real good signal strength, and it,just seemed that right there at about 239Â° in yaw, that the signal strength,would just drop off and yaw would go to 0 and pitch would go to 90.;CAPCOM
42063.8;INCO;That's good.;FLIGHT
42064.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;INCO
42094.8;CAPCOM;Roger. We copy, and the TV show was great.;CMP
42095.8;FLIGHT;Good report.;INCO
42099.8;GNC;FLIGHT, GNC.;FLIGHT
42100.8;FLIGHT;Go, GNC.;GNC
42101.8;CMP;Okay, real fine. Okay, I'm going to maneuver to 060, 090, and 0.;CAPCOM
42102.8;GNC;Can we verify that they reenabled C-4 thruster?;FLIGHT
42110.8;FLIGHT;Okay. Verify that they re- - you're showing that disabled, yes?;GNC
42113.8;GNC;Yes.;FLIGHT
42114.8;FLIGHT;CAPCOM, we're still seeing CM C-4 thruster disabled.;CAPCOM
42120.8;CAPCOM;And 13, we'd like you to check C-4 thruster.;CMP
42123.8;EECOM;FLIGHT, EECOM.;FLIGHT
42124.8;FLIGHT;Go EECOM.;EECOM
42125.8;EECOM;We've got 40 amp-hours back in battery B now.;FLIGHT
42127.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;EECOM
42133.8;CONTROL;You got it, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
42134.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;CONTROL
42144.8;FLIGHT;Okay, all flight controllers. I want to go around the horn and pick up anything,you need configuration-wise. TELMU -;TELMU
42151.8;TELMU;Go ahead, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
42152.8;FLIGHT;#NAAM?;TELMU
42155.8;TELMU;Negative. The LM heater current indicates that the LM was properly closed out.,They apparently have not closed the LM hatch yet.;FLIGHT
42165.8;FLIGHT;Okay. So you're happy that you don't need them to verify that - what was it,,Activation 2-3, those pages we were on?;TELMU
42172.8;TELMU;That's right. It was TLC 2, and we're happy.;FLIGHT

42184.8;FLIGHT;CAPCOM will get that for me.;GUIDO
42187.8;CAPCOM;Roger. We see it, Jack. And we've got a reading of -2Â° on the docking index.,We'd like to know if that's 2.0 precise or if it's 2.1 or 1.9.;CMP
42203.8;CMP;No. It's -2.0 precisely.;CAPCOM
42206.8;CAPCOM;Thank you.;CMP

42458.8;FLIGHT;Go, INCO.;INCO
42459.8;LMP;Okay. Right now, Houston the voltage is looking good. And we had a pretty large,bang associated with the CAUTION AND WARNING there. And as I recall, MAIN B was,the one that had an amp spike on it once before.;CAPCOM
42460.8;INCO;We switched to WIDE BEAM width about the time we had the problem.;FLIGHT
42483.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;INCO

42710.8;CAPCOM;"Okay, is that all we've come up with for them; have we got any other,recommendations?";FLIGHT
42715.8;FLIGHT;Yeah, we wanted to get FUEL CELL 1 configured to MAIN A, FUEL CELL 3 to MAIN B.,Did you pass that up?;CAPCOM
42721.8;EECOM;Let's attempt that, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
42723.8;CAPCOM;13, Houston. We'd like you to attempt to reconnect fuel cell 1 to MAIN A and,fuel cell 3 to MAIN B. Verify that quad Delta is open.;LMP
42726.8;FLIGHT;INCO, this seems to be an AC type problem, it may be tied into that high-gain,thing you got.;INCO
42735.8;INCO;We went to WIDE BEAM WIDTH - FLIGHT - at 55:55:04, best we can tell.;FLIGHT
42738.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;INCO
42743.8;LMP;Okay, Houston. I'm showing - I tried to reset and fuel cell 1 and 3 are both,showing grey flags, but they're both showing zip on the flows.;CAPCOM
42755.8;EECOM;I copy, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
42757.8;CAPCOM;We copy.;LMP
42758.8;EECOM;Let me commiserate on that.;FLIGHT
42765.8;CAPCOM;Is there any kind of leads we can give them? Are we looking at instrumentation,or have we got a real problem, or what?;EECOM
42784.8;EECOM;Roger. FLIGHT, EECOM.;FLIGHT
42785.8;FLIGHT;Go, EECOM.;EECOM
42786.8;EECOM;Let's reverse the configuration request -;FLIGHT
42787.8;FLIGHT;Okay, but wait a minute. We've got a good MAIN A BUS, let's make sure that,whatever we do doesn't screw up MAIN A. MAIN A -;EECOM
42793.8;EECOM;FUEL CELL 2 is on MAIN A, FLIGHT -;FLIGHT
42795.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;EECOM
42796.8;EECOM;- and I'm not going to ask to change that.;FLIGHT
42797.8;FLIGHT;Okay, what do you want to do?;EECOM
42798.8;EECOM;Let's try to put FUEL CELL 1 on MAIN B, FUEL CELL 3 on MAIN A. We'll use the,other sensing circuitry.;FLIGHT

42810.8;EECOM;- FUEL CELL 3 on MAIN A.;FLIGHT
42818.8;EECOM;We're not going to touch FUEL CELL 2, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
42821.8;FLIGHT;Okay, but if we got any problems in the system I want to make sure that we,don't blow the voltage off MAIN A, then we're not going to be able to see,anything.;EECOM
42837.8;FLIGHT;Can we review our status here, Sy, and see what we've got from a standpoint of,status. What do you think we've got in the spacecraft that's good?;EECOM
42845.8;EECOM;MAIN BUS A is reading 25 volts.;FLIGHT
42848.8;FLIGHT;Okay. MAIN A -;EECOM
42849.8;EECOM;And that's reflected by the fact - FUEL CELL 2 is putting out 53 amps, which is,just about the most it can and keep our voltage up.;FLIGHT
42857.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;EECOM
42858.8;EECOM;So that's bona fide. AC BUS 2 is 0, which is reflected by the fact that we lost,MAIN B.;FLIGHT

42908.8;INCO;Right.;FLIGHT
42911.8;LMP;In the interim, to help out MAIN A voltage, I've got MAIN BUS TIE BAT A/C on.,Or would you rather accept the 25 volts we are seeing on MAIN A?;CAPCOM
42918.8;FLIGHT;You don't think we're going to be able to get HIGH BIT RATE data here, do you?,On the OMNIs.;INCO
42921.8;CAPCOM;Okay. BUS TIE A/C on.;LMP
42922.8;INCO;We may be. We've got the 210s.;FLIGHT

43156.8;EECOM;FLIGHT, EECOM.;FLIGHT
43157.8;FLIGHT;Go ahead.;EECOM
43160.8;EECOM;Why don't we try - leave FUEL CELL 2 alone, and just make sure that 1 and 3 are,disconnected from both buses. And make sure that there's abs - that there won't,be any load on them at all. And let's see what happens to those cells.;FLIGHT
43175.8;FLIGHT;Okay, what do you want to do? Open-circuit FUEL CELL 1 and 3?;EECOM
43178.8;EECOM;That's affirm, flight.;FLIGHT
43179.8;FLIGHT;Okay. CAPCOM, let's recommend we open-circuit FUEL CELL number 1 and number 3,and leave FUEL CELL number 2 as-is.;CAPCOM
43190.8;CAPCOM;Okay, 1 and 3 open-circuit, 2 as-is. And earlier we got a report from them that,1 and 3 were reading grey but zero flow.;FLIGHT
43198.8;FLIGHT;Yeah - CAPCOM, let's amend that. EECOM, from FLIGHT.;EECOM
43201.8;EECOM;FLIGHT, EECOM.;FLIGHT
43202.8;FLIGHT;Why don't we just open-circuit 1 and make sure we don't have any problems,getting that back onto the bus -;EECOM
43207.8;EECOM;Okay, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
43208.8;FLIGHT;- and just watch it for a while before we make any further moves with 3.;EECOM
43210.8;EECOM;Roger.;FLIGHT
43211.8;FLIGHT;Okay, CAPCOM. Let's just open-circuit one of those right now.;CAPCOM
43215.8;CAPCOM;13, Houston. We'd like you to open-circuit FUEL CELL 1. Leave 2 and 3 as-is.;LMP
43224.8;LMP;Okay. I'll get to work on that.;CAPCOM
43226.8;CDR;And Jack, our Oâ‚‚ QUANTITY number 2 tank is reading 0. Did you get that?;CAPCOM
43227.8;GNC;FLIGHT, GNC.;FLIGHT
43233.8;CAPCOM;Oâ‚‚ QUANTITY number 2 is 0.;CDR
43234.8;EECOM;That's roger, FLIGHT. That's the AC problem.;FLIGHT
43236.8;CDR;That's AC, okay. Yeah, that's because of AC and it looks to me, looking out the,hatch, that we are venting something. We are venting something out into the -,into space.;CAPCOM
43237.8;FLIGHT;Roger.;EECOM
43245.8;FLIGHT;Crew thinks they're venting something.;EECOM
43247.8;EECOM;I heard it, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
43251.8;CAPCOM;Roger. We copy your venting.;CDR
43256.8;CAPCOM;Copy that, FLIGHT?;FLIGHT
43257.8;CDR;It's a gas of some sort.;CAPCOM
43258.8;FLIGHT;Roger.;CAPCOM
43262.8;FLIGHT;Okay, let's everybody think of the kinds of things that we'd be venting. GNC,,you got anything that looks abnormal in your system?;GNC
43268.8;GNC;Negative, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
43272.8;FLIGHT;How about you, EECOM? You see anything that - with the instrumentation you've,got that could be venting?;EECOM
43277.8;LMP;Okay, FUEL CELL 1 you just wanted it off the line now, Jack, is that right?;CAPCOM
43281.8;CAPCOM;We just wanted you to open the circuit on fuel cell 1.;LMP
43282.8;EECOM;That's affirm, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
43287.8;LMP;Okay, she's off the line.;CAPCOM
43290.8;EECOM;Let me look at the system, FLIGHT, as far as the venting is concerned.;FLIGHT
43292.8;FLIGHT;Okay. Let's start scanning. I assume you've called in your backup EECOMs?;EECOM
43299.8;FLIGHT;EECOM?;EECOM
43300.8;EECOM;FLIGHT, say again?;FLIGHT
43301.8;FLIGHT;Have you called in your backup EECOMs now? See if we can get some more brain,power on this thing?;EECOM
43304.8;EECOM;We got one here.;FLIGHT

43308.8;INCO;He's - he's - never mind, he's straightening up a little bit.;FLIGHT
43310.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;INCO
43334.8;FLIGHT;Okay, now, let's everybody keep cool. We've got the LM still attached, the LM,spacecraft is good, so if we need to get back home we've got a LM to do a good,portion of it with. Okay? Let's make sure we don't do anything that's going to,blow our CSM electrical power with the batteries, or that will cause us to lose,the MAIN - the FUEL CELL number 2. We want to keep the Oâ‚‚ and that kind of,stuff working, we'd like to have RCS. But we've got the Command Module system,,so we're in good shape if we need to get home. Let's solve the problem, but,let's not make it any worse by guessin'.;ALL
43395.8;GNC;FLIGHT, GNC.;FLIGHT

43839.8;GNC;In the order of about 20 minutes to damp out and then spin up and then we can,do without any of that.;FLIGHT
43846.8;GNC;If we get a good spinup going then we're stable -;FLIGHT
43848.8;FLIGHT;Okay, that might be a good idea. That would buy us some more time from a,standpoint of reviewing the data. And it would get us back into the - as close,to the normal flight plan as we could. How far are we out of attitude right now?;GNC
43866.8;GNC;He's a fair ways out right now, FLIGHT. He'd have to do another VERB 49 and fly,back and then stabilize there.;FLIGHT
43945.8;EECOM;FLIGHT, EECOM.;FLIGHT
43946.8;FLIGHT;Go, EECOM.;EECOM
43947.8;EECOM;Okay, I need one thing right now. He's powering down, he's down to 41 amps,,total spacecraft. I'd like to get my AC 2 BUS back so I can look at Oâ‚‚ TANK 2,PRESSURE. I have no insight into that.;FLIGHT
43961.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;EECOM
43962.8;EECOM;Let's get - I guess we can put INVERTER 3 to MAIN A. AC 2.;FLIGHT
43971.8;EECOM;And let's just do it temporarily -;FLIGHT
43972.8;FLIGHT;Now, let me ask you a question - before you do that would you like to make sure,you've got all AC load you don't need isolated from the bus?;EECOM
43981.8;EECOM;Nah, it - let's not do that right now, FLIGHT. I think we're in good shape that,way. The MAIN A is up high enough where it can handle the inverter.;FLIGHT
43988.8;FLIGHT;Well, the thing that concerns me is starting - is throwing equipment - we had a,problem, we don't know the cause of the problem, and -;EECOM
43994.8;EECOM;FLIGHT, I've got a feeling we've lost two fuel cells. I hate to put it that,way, but - I don't know why we've lost them. It doesn't all tag up. And it's,not an instrumentation problem, the best I can tell right now.;FLIGHT
44008.8;FLIGHT;Okay, I'll tell you what. Let's discuss this for just a little bit longer,there, Sy. CAPCOM, start them moving back towards a PTC attitude, let's start,him going into his rate damping. I feel it's going to be a relatively long,period of time to try and nail down the problem. Go ahead.;CAPCOM
44015.8;CMP;Okay Jack. Are you happy with the amps we have now?;CAPCOM
44020.8;CAPCOM;Standby 1, Fred.;CMP
44022.8;CAPCOM;He's asking how do we like his amperage setup right now?;FLIGHT
44024.8;CMP;Okay Jack, and on this page 1-5, we proceeded right down the list, all the way,down. We're right now at BMAG number 2 is in WARM UP.;CAPCOM
44027.8;FLIGHT;Are you happy with his power level right now, EECOM?;EECOM
44035.8;CAPCOM;Roger. We copy BMAG 2 in WARM UP. We'll follow you through.;CMP
44037.8;INCO;FLIGHT, INCO.;FLIGHT
44038.8;FLIGHT;Go ahead.;INCO
44039.8;INCO;I'd like to - for him to secure the high-gain before he starts getting into PTC.;FLIGHT
44041.8;CMP;Okay, and something is giving us some rates, Jack, both in pitch and roll, so,I'm suspecting that maybe it's whatever it is that's venting back there. I've,had to use DIRECT in order to stabilize this, and as soon as I do, we're,starting to pick up rates again. Can you pick up any jets firing?;CAPCOM
44062.8;CAPCOM;Standby.;CMP
44063.8;GNC;That's affirmative, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
44064.8;FLIGHT;GNC? What's firing now? You got something firing?;GNC
44067.8;GNC;Well, we've seen quite a bit of thruster activity.;FLIGHT
44068.8;CAPCOM;What direction are your rates in, Jack?;CMP
44070.8;FLIGHT;Okay, I guess this kills the PTC, too, because we're not going to get into PTC,as long as we've got something venting.;GNC
44075.8;CMP;It's negative pitch and negative roll.;CAPCOM
44080.8;GNC;Roger, FLIGHT. That agrees with what we're seeing here.;FLIGHT
44081.8;CAPCOM;Roger.;CMP
44083.8;EECOM;FLIGHT, EECOM.;FLIGHT
44084.8;FLIGHT;Go, EECOM.;EECOM
44085.8;EECOM;I've got a little correction. Let's put INVERTER 1 on both AC buses, please.;FLIGHT
44089.8;FLIGHT;INVERTER 1 on both AC. Why?;EECOM
44091.8;EECOM;That's affirm, so I can get some AC BUS power back so I can have some insight,into my AC BUS 2 telemetry, especially my cryos, maybe - the venting may be,coming from that. And also, I think that the FUEL CELL 2 pumps are on AC 2, and,this will take care of it without switching the pumps yet.;FLIGHT
44113.8;FLIGHT;Say that again. You think your fuel cell pumps -;EECOM
44116.8;EECOM;Yeah. FUEL CELL 2 pumps I think are on AC 2.;FLIGHT
44119.8;FLIGHT;Okay, but according to the checklist, he should have powered - he should have,turned those off, right? Now, he said he was down to BMAG number 2 is in WARM,UP, so he's already gone through the fuel cell pump stuff.;EECOM
44129.8;EECOM;Okay. Good enough.;FLIGHT
44131.8;FLIGHT;Okay, so you want to configure INVERTER 1 on both AC buses.;EECOM
44136.8;EECOM;That's affirm, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
44150.8;CAPCOM;FLIGHT, I didn't - I was listening to the spacecraft and I didn't pass up,INVERTER 3 to MAIN A to AC 2, did you delete that?;FLIGHT
44157.8;FLIGHT;No, we deleted that.;CAPCOM
44159.8;CAPCOM;Alright.;FLIGHT
44164.8;FLIGHT;You want to put INVERTER 1 on both AC BUSES. EECOM and CAPCOM, let's do it.;CAPCOM
44168.8;CAPCOM;Okay.;FLIGHT
44170.8;CAPCOM;13, Houston. We need to get some more instrumentation up. We'd like you to put,INVERTER 1 on both AC BUSES. Over.;LMP

44195.8;FLIGHT;- take a look at the prelaunch data and go through your systems and see if,there's anything you've got that may have started venting here?;CONTROL
44197.8;CONTROL;Roger, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
44198.8;TELMU;We'll look.;FLIGHT
44199.8;FLIGHT;Okay. And I want a report on that in about the next fifteen minutes. Quick look,type stuff.;CONTROL

44207.8;FDO;We're definitely seeing a vent in the data.;FLIGHT
44208.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;FDO
44209.8;LMP;And Jack, one of the items that we turned off was the - all the fuel cell,pumps. Okay, and you might let us know when fuel cell 2 needs its pump back. We,ought to take care of that guy.;CAPCOM

44272.8;NETWORK;Roger that.;FLIGHT
44274.8;CAPCOM;FLIGHT, did you hear him say he's getting some rates? We want to know if he's,firing any thrusters?;FLIGHT
44280.8;FLIGHT;Roger. GNC, watch those thrusters, will you?;GNC
44283.8;GNC;GNC. Say again?;FLIGHT
44284.8;FLIGHT;Have you got any thrusters firing?;GNC
44286.8;GNC;We're looking at that C-3 thruster, FLIGHT. It looks like it stays on most of,the time.;FLIGHT
44291.8;FLIGHT;Well, can we turn them all off and see if we've still got the rates or any,build-up in rates?;GNC
44295.8;GNC;Well, the rates that we're seeing is opposite to the direction of that,thruster, so if anything it's just trying to hold and not quite up to it.;FLIGHT
44302.8;FLIGHT;Okay, but -;GNC
44303.8;CAPCOM;He's been trying to counteract the rates with DIRECT. He's been getting a,negative pitch and a negative roll.;FLIGHT
44311.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;CAPCOM
44315.8;CAPCOM;But he asked if we were getting some thruster firings that were not being made,by him.;FLIGHT
44320.8;FLIGHT;I'll tell you what, GNC can you get somebody in the back room to try to figure,out what the equivalent âˆ†V is we're getting? So that we can see if we can,backtrack to see if we can figure out what's venting.;GNC
44338.8;FLIGHT;In other words, do - it would seem we could equate that to effective thrust and,an axis and then deduce what's venting.;GNC
44345.8;GNC;Roger, we'll give that a try, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
44346.8;FLIGHT;Okay. And that might be of interest to the LM guys.;GNC
44350.8;CAPCOM;He also said it was coming past window number 1.;FLIGHT

44588.8;GNC;We would like to turn thruster Alpha 3 on MAIN A and see that'll help control,that pitch and at the same time we can turn off Charlie 3 because -;FLIGHT
44595.8;FLIGHT;Okay. Get me some real-time plotting on how we're using RCS here, will you?;GNC
44599.8;GNC;Roger, FLIGHT. And in the pitch axis we really don't seem to be using any. And,that's why we'd like to go to Alpha and see if that changes it any.;FLIGHT

46428.8;FDO;When the systems men can stand it, I need two minutes for a checkpoint to save,all this data.;FLIGHT
46434.8;FLIGHT;I don't see why we couldn't - EECOM, GNC, can you stand a checkpoint right now?;EECOM
46444.8;EECOM;It only takes a minute, I guess I'll have to if we need it, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
46446.8;GNC;Go ahead, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
46447.8;FLIGHT;Yeah, I think it'd be good to get a checkpoint. Go ahead.;EECOM
46449.8;FLIGHT;EECOM, have you deduced anything - have you seen your REACTANT VALVES go off?,You seen flow cease?;EECOM
46459.8;EECOM;Can't tell, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
46460.8;FLIGHT;Yeah.;EECOM
46461.8;EECOM;They were open-circuited, and the pressure - still appears to be going down.;FLIGHT

46507.8;EECOM;We'd better confirm that the FUEL CELL 3 REACTANT VALVE circuit breaker on,panel 226 was closed when he shut those.;FLIGHT
46515.8;FLIGHT;FUEL CELL 3 REACTANT circuit breaker on what panel?;EECOM
46519.8;EECOM;226.;FLIGHT
46522.8;EECOM;They're normally open.;FLIGHT
46526.8;FLIGHT;Okay, good idea.;EECOM
46528.8;CAPCOM;You want them - close the circuit breaker -;FLIGHT
46530.8;FLIGHT;Yeah.;CAPCOM

46532.8;FLIGHT;Yeah.;CAPCOM
46533.8;EECOM;"Yeah, FLIGHT; he should have gotten a barber pole on that.";FLIGHT
46545.8;FLIGHT;Yeah, wouldn't he get a barber pole when he turned the reactants off? EECOM?;EECOM
46551.8;EECOM;Affirm, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
46552.8;FLIGHT;Even with the circuit breaker open?;EECOM
46554.8;EECOM;No -;FLIGHT
46555.8;FLIGHT;No. Okay, so he ought to know that. We can just verify that he got a -;EECOM

46563.8;FDO;Okay, FLIGHT. We have our checkpoint.;FLIGHT
46565.8;FLIGHT;Okay. All flight controllers, I'd suggest you start handing over, because I,think a fresh team's probably going to be thinking clearer. I think the rest of,us can continue working in some other function in support of the new team,coming on.;FDO
46576.8;CAPCOM;Okay. You say no pitch in either DIRECT or AUTO? You want to bring on A-4?;CMP

46649.8;CAPCOM;Roger.;LMP
46650.8;EECOM;Copy.;INCO
46661.8;FLIGHT;Okay. All flight controllers, I'm handing over to Glynn. I assume the majority,of all the team guys are pretty much briefed and up to speed as best we can.,Now what I'd suggest is the white team do two things: they go over the delogs -,okay - let me go back over this again. We're handing over to Glynn. I'd suggest,the white team goes back and starts going through the delog of the data. In,other words, let's see if we can go back to the initial conditions and work on,that problem to see if we can find out what happened and we may find some,better clues as to what to do and let the fresh guys come on and try to figure,out where do we go from here.;ALL
46700.8;FLIGHT;And the delog is in way now. Roger.;ALL
46721.8;FLIGHT;Okay, EECOM. Tell me about the latch. Do you think you've got the reactants,latched?;EECOM
46728.8;EECOM;FLIGHT, EECOM.;FLIGHT
46729.8;FLIGHT;Go.;EECOM
46730.8;EECOM;The crew reported he got barber pole whenever he threw the reactant switch, so,that implies that he did all the right things and he really got it shut off.,And it looks like that didn't help us any - the pressure's not improving any.;FLIGHT
46744.8;FLIGHT;Okay, now the next question is: are you willing to do that on FUEL CELL number,1?;EECOM
46749.8;EECOM;That's the question we're pondering, FLIGHT. We've got to come up with an,answer on that one. Soon.;FLIGHT
46755.8;FLIGHT;FUEL CELL 2 is working okay.;EECOM
46757.8;EECOM;That's affirmative.;FLIGHT
46758.8;FLIGHT;Unless we do something to get that oxygen, it's not going to do us any good to,save fuel cells.;EECOM

46964.8;LMP;That's 2 Bravo is reading - oh, about 0.25 to 0.3.;CAPCOM
46972.8;FLIGHT;EECOM, I don't like the way that Oâ‚‚ pressure's going down. If you want to do,something about these other reactant valves, let's make up our mind.;EECOM

46979.8;FLIGHT;Don't you think?;EECOM
46980.8;EECOM;Let me get that for you in a minute, FLIGHT. Let's standby on these readouts.;FLIGHT
46983.8;FLIGHT;Yeah, okay. Anybody can copy the readouts. Be sure you're discussing these,reactants.;EECOM
46988.8;LMP;Okay. 2-C is reading 4.1.;CAPCOM
47001.8;CAPCOM;Hey, FLIGHT. CAPCOM. Long time ago I heard someone mention something about,closing the REPRESS package and then we never made a decision on that. Do you,want to do that, too?;FLIGHT
47010.8;FLIGHT;EECOM? - he's busy.;EECOM
47013.8;EECOM;Go, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
47014.8;FLIGHT;Do you want to close out the REPRESS pack? I think that came on for them before.;EECOM
47018.8;EECOM;We indicated earlier that we'd like to get it closed off -;FLIGHT
47019.8;LMP;And 3-A is reading 4.0.;CAPCOM
47021.8;FLIGHT;Yes, Jack.;EECOM
47024.8;CAPCOM;Roger, 4.0. Say again what it is, please.;LMP
47030.8;EECOM;FLIGHT, EECOM.;FLIGHT
47031.8;LMP;3 Able. 3-A.;CAPCOM
47032.8;FLIGHT;Go ahead.;EECOM
47033.8;EECOM;Okay, on the reactants for FUEL CELL 1. Seems to me we have no choice but to go,ahead and do it. The pressure continues to drop. We're not going to have,anything left soon anyway. So, looks like the next best thing to try is to go,ahead and turn the reactants OFF on FUEL CELL 1.;FLIGHT
47050.8;FLIGHT;Yeah. What is this pounds on your display, Clint?;EECOM
47054.8;EECOM;On Oâ‚‚?;FLIGHT
47055.8;FLIGHT;Yup.;EECOM

47064.8;EECOM;And of course, you'll want to make sure that his circuit breaker is closed for,FUEL CELL 1 when he starts to close the reactant valves.;FLIGHT
47067.8;LMP;And 3-D is reading 1.95.;CAPCOM
47071.8;FLIGHT;Which circuit breaker is that? The one on 226?;EECOM
47073.8;EECOM;Roger.;FLIGHT
47077.8;FLIGHT;That's FUEL CELL number 1.;EECOM
47079.8;EECOM;That's right, FUEL CELL reactants number 1.;FLIGHT
47081.8;FLIGHT;Alright.;EECOM
47083.8;FLIGHT;Is he done with that readout yet?;EECOM
47087.8;EECOM;I didn't copy the last part of it there, FLIGHT -;FLIGHT
47099.8;FLIGHT;EECOM, FLIGHT.;EECOM
47101.8;EECOM;Go, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
47102.8;FLIGHT;Is there any chance that I'm just looking at a bad pressure reading here? I'm,going to shut off the second fuel cell now, is there any data you can correlate,that says that yeah, that pressure is going down?;EECOM
47112.8;EECOM;On the Oâ‚‚ tank?;FLIGHT
47113.8;FLIGHT;Yes.;EECOM
47118.8;FLIGHT;You understand my question?;EECOM
47119.8;EECOM;I understand your question. The temperatures are also dropping. Let me get a,verification on that - standby just a minute.;FLIGHT
47127.8;FLIGHT;Alright.;EECOM
47137.8;LMP;And Houston, 13. Oâ‚‚ tank pressure number 1 is less than 300 now.;CAPCOM
47142.8;FLIGHT;Yeah, we copy that. Tell them we're debating shutting off the reactants on 1.;EECOM
47143.8;CAPCOM;Roger. We're seeing that. We confirm it.;LMP
47146.8;EECOM;FLIGHT, EECOM.;FLIGHT
47147.8;FLIGHT;Go ahead.;EECOM
47148.8;EECOM;The temperature is the only thing we have.;FLIGHT
47149.8;FLIGHT;And does it correlate?;EECOM
47150.8;EECOM;Pretty closely.;FLIGHT
47151.8;FLIGHT;You're saying that I'm looking at a valid pressure in that tank, and it's still,going down.;EECOM
47155.8;EECOM;That's the way it looks, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
47156.8;FLIGHT;Therefore?;EECOM
47157.8;EECOM;Therefore we need to go to FUEL CELL 1 and turn off the reactants.;FLIGHT
47161.8;FLIGHT;CAPCOM, FUEL CELL 1 reactants. Circuit breaker and a switch.;CAPCOM
47165.8;CAPCOM;Okay - you want them to go through the fuel cell shutdown procedure on 1?;FLIGHT

47171.8;FLIGHT;Do you want them to go through the fuel cell shutdown procedure on 1?;EECOM
47174.8;EECOM;That's affirmative.;FLIGHT
47175.8;FLIGHT;Yes, Jack.;EECOM
47177.8;CAPCOM;Because -;FLIGHT

47842.8;FLIGHT;I'm trying to be sure that you're satisfied that there's nothing else we can do.;EECOM
47845.8;EECOM;About all we can do is power down and let heat leak help us some - which is,probably going to be trivial.;FLIGHT

47887.8;GUIDO;Go ahead, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
47888.8;FLIGHT;CONTROL. Question is, do you want to do a quick P52 on the CSM so that we can,do an align to the LM? I don't know if we want to keep that LM platform up all,that time anyway.;CONTROL

47903.8;FLIGHT;Yeah.;CONTROL
47904.8;GUIDO;Mine, too.;FLIGHT
47905.8;FLIGHT;Okay, CAPCOM, we don't see any need in doing that, because we wouldn't be using,the LM platform until about 79 hours.;CAPCOM

47920.8;CONTROL;FLIGHT, CONTROL.;FLIGHT
47923.8;CAPCOM;And Jack, in regard to your question about the P52 and LM platform, it's -,there's no need to worry about that now. We wouldn't be using the LM platform,for - until about 79 hours, so let's go as-is on the platform for now. Over.;CMP

47982.8;EECOM;Negative, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
47983.8;FLIGHT;Okay. GNC, can you help EECOM there as to what else you might power down, if,anything? I don't know whether you can or not.;GNC
47988.8;GNC;Roger, FLIGHT. We'll work on that, although we're in an ATTITUDE HOLD situation,here, and I'd hate to give up the CMC and the IMU right now.;FLIGHT
47998.8;FLIGHT;Yeah, well the CMC doesn't matter.;GNC
48003.8;GNC;Okay, we'll work on it, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT

48048.8;TELMU;Go, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
48049.8;FLIGHT;- join in here. The question is, should we try to do a quick align with the CSM,and do an alignment in the LM? Can we keep an alignment in the LM up until 79,hours? Can you keep that kind of power on?;TELMU
48059.8;TELMU;Standby.;FLIGHT
48061.8;FLIGHT;The pilots are reporting it's difficult to do that alignment from scratch in,the LM docked.;TELMU

48074.8;TELMU;Standby 1, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
48075.8;FLIGHT;Alright. Pronto.;TELMU
48085.8;GNC;FLIGHT, GNC. We'd save a little power if we turn all the jets off in QUAD C.,We're pulsing those jets and we suspect that we've - closed the PROP ISOL,VALVES in QUAD C so it's doing us no good right now, so we need to turn off all,the jets in the quad.;FLIGHT
48102.8;FLIGHT;Oh, okay, you mean RCS SELECT -;GNC

48168.8;FLIGHT;Confirm: Quad Charlie is PROP ISOL'd off, right?;GNC
48172.8;GNC;Well, we haven't confirmed that, FLIGHT, but it appears that that's the,situation we're in. The shock of the Oâ‚‚ thing, it probably closed those valves -;FLIGHT
48184.8;FLIGHT;Oh, you think -;GNC
48185.8;GNC;- and we haven't been able to open them because those are powered off of MAIN B.;FLIGHT
48188.8;FLIGHT;Mm. Okay.;GNC
48189.8;GNC;But A appears to be working okay.;FLIGHT
48191.8;FLIGHT;"Okay. We think Quad Charlie's PROP ISOL'd off, Jack, so in that case we ought,to turn off the AUTO RCS SELECT; that'll save a little power. Probably not much.";GNC
48202.8;CAPCOM;Yeah - you want AUTO RCS OFF on Charlie?;FLIGHT
48204.8;FLIGHT;Uh huh.;CAPCOM
48205.8;CAPCOM;How about antennas? How are we doing? Did I hear them give me some bad COMM,there?;FLIGHT

48309.8;EECOM;Okay.;FLIGHT
48323.8;FLIGHT;We've got a power up procedure here from TELMU but we've got to start thinking,about what you want pow - configured in the ECS and the COMM.;EECOM
48329.8;EECOM;Right.;FLIGHT
48330.8;TELMU;That gets power in the LM, and then we'll get you some COMM and TM here.;FLIGHT

54342.8;CDR;Well, I'd rather have a timer going so that we - then we can put it in the,DSKY. Then we shut down the mission timer.;LMP
54347.8;LMP;Oh, is that what you want to do?;CDR
54348.8;LMP; Is that what you want to do?;CDR
54349.8;CDR; Yes. Hey, Omni.;LMP
54352.8;FLIGHT;You want FORWARD OMNI?;INCO
54353.8;LMP; Great.;CDR
54354.8;INCO;Roger.;FLIGHT
54358.8;CDR;Switch them. Okay, let's fire up the mission timer.;LMP
54359.8;FLIGHT;CAPCOM, FLIGHT.;CAPCOM
54361.8;INCO;Hurry.;FLIGHT
54364.8;FLIGHT;CAPCOM, you need to - going to need to get FORWARD OMNI in the LM.;CAPCOM
54370.8;CAPCOM; Aquarius, we need Forward Omni.;CDR
54371.8;INCO;I believe he's already done it, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
54372.8;FLIGHT;Okay. Oh, it's already done. Hm. Okay.;INCO
54374.8;CAPCOM;Okay, and he's going to write a mission time into the LGC.;FLIGHT
54375.8;CDR; Forward Omni.;CAPCOM
54378.8;LMP; Say again, Jack.;CDR
54380.8;CDR; Forward Omni.;LMP
54381.8;LMP; I am. Okay, Houston. If that call was an Omni switch, I'm in Forward now.;CAPCOM
54382.8;LMP;I am.;CDR
54384.8;FLIGHT;Can you do this when you don't have a DSKY? Time?;CAPCOM
54390.8;LMP;Okay, Houston. If that call was an OMNI switch, I'm in FORWARD now.;CAPCOM
54397.8;FLIGHT;That'll give him his clock, will it, RETRO?;RETRO
54398.8;CDR; Okay, Freddo, how do I get the mission timer up? I got the mission timer cranked in.;LMP
54401.8;RETRO;That's affirmative.;FLIGHT
54402.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;RETRO
54403.8;CONTROL;FLIGHT, CONTROL.;FLIGHT
54404.8;LMP;You got it on?;CDR
54406.8;FLIGHT;Go ahead.;CONTROL
54407.8;CDR; I got the mission timer circuit breaker in.;LMP
54409.8;CONTROL;Okay, if he wants to turn his inverters off, we can monitor his middle gimbal,angle here for him. One other suggestion I have is that he -;FLIGHT
54410.8;LMP;Okay, we're going to probably need NUMERICS LIGHTING. There you go, you got it.;CDR
54412.8;FLIGHT;Wait, wait a minute. Let me - let me hear the COMM, here.;CONTROL
54417.8;CAPCOM;Aquarius, Houston. I think we've got a better way of getting your mission time,up.;CDR
54426.8;CDR; Go ahead with it.;CAPCOM
54429.8;CAPCOM;"Okay. We can do a Verb 55, Enter, and then put an R1, minus 00088. In R2, minus 00059; R3 minus 03274.";CDR
54458.8;LMP; Watch the crapping attitude.;CDR
54462.8;CDR;We're okay.;LMP
54466.8;LMP; God damn. I wish you'd get to something I know.;CDR
54471.8;CDR; Well, as soon as we get over here, we'll stop it with the TTCA.;LMP
54473.8;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
54474.8;RETRO;FLIGHT, RETRO. They've got a good clock update.;FLIGHT
54475.8;LMP;Okay.;CDR
54476.8;CAPCOM;" And, Aquarius; Houston. We've got you both on VOX.";LMP
54478.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;RETRO
54483.8;INCO;FLIGHT, INCO.;FLIGHT
54484.8;LMP; Like to go what?;CDR
54485.8;LMP;They've got what?;CAPCOM
54486.8;FLIGHT;Go ahead.;INCO
54487.8;CDR; You want us on VOX, Jack?;LMP
54488.8;INCO;When we get a chance here, we'd like to take and change our offset on the two,vehicles, on how we're getting telemetry, to try to solve this tracking,problem. To do that we're going to have to drop the LM uplink and break lock,for maybe 5 to 10, 20 seconds, there.;FLIGHT
54490.8;CAPCOM; We have you on VOX. We're reading you loud and clear and the clock took good. [Long pause.];CDR
54499.8;FLIGHT;Okay. Well, let's just standby on that a minute.;INCO
54500.8;INCO;Okay.;FLIGHT
54506.8;FLIGHT;Okay. Now, before we get into that one -;INCO
54507.8;LMP; Okay. Looks like we're on the FDA route there, Jack. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
54515.8;GUIDO;FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.;FLIGHT
54516.8;FLIGHT;Go ahead.;GUIDO
54517.8;GUIDO;We'd like to have a VERB 74 some time when they can skip the DSKY.;FLIGHT
54520.8;FLIGHT;Okay, GUIDANCE. CAPCOM, we're ready for an E-MEMORY dump. They'll give us a,VERB 74, that's what you're talking about, isn't it, GUIDANCE?;GUIDO
54527.8;GUIDO;Roger, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
54528.8;FLIGHT;We're getting an E-MEMORY dump.;GUIDO
54529.8;LMP; Okay, Jack. How do you read me on Normal Voice now?;CAPCOM
54532.8;CAPCOM;Hearing you 5 square, Fred.;LMP
54536.8;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
54539.8;FLIGHT;CONTROL, FLIGHT. You saw an increase in the ascent tanks, is that right?,Pressure?;CONTROL
54543.8;CONTROL;Yes.;FLIGHT
54544.8;FLIGHT;And you want to be sure, what, that the ascent feeds are closed -;CONTROL
54546.8;CONTROL;Yeah. Close those breakers and cycle those valves closed. Do not cycle to the,open position, just to the close position.;FLIGHT
54553.8;CAPCOM;- when he pressurized the -;FLIGHT
54554.8;FLIGHT;Yeah, RCS. And we want to do an E-MEMORY dump whenever they can get around to,it, we're all ready to receive it.;CONTROL
54560.8;CONTROL;Okay, I've got one item, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
54562.8;CAPCOM;And Aquarius, we're ready for a VERB 74 when you can give it to us.;LMP
54564.8;FLIGHT;Say again?;CONTROL
54565.8;CONTROL;This is CONTROL. We want to power down his inverters -;CAPCOM
54569.8;CAPCOM;Coming at you.;CONTROL
54570.8;CONTROL;- and in order to do that, we're going to have to look at his middle gimbal,angle for him on the ground. And to make it easier, he needs to get out of this,MIN IMPULSE mode. He needs to go to - PGNS MODE CONTROL to AUTO when he gets to,an attitude that he likes.;FLIGHT
54573.8;LMP; You got it.;CAPCOM
54575.8;CAPCOM;Okay. And one other thing we noticed. When you pressurized the RCS, we got an increase in pressure in the ascent tanks, and so we want to have you verify that the ascent feeds are closed. In order to do that, on panel 11, close the Ascent Feed 1 and 2 circuit breakers on - and cycle the Parker valves, and then open the Ascent Feed circuit breakers on panel 11. [Pause.];LMP
54583.8;FLIGHT;That's - yeah. Okay.;CONTROL
54586.8;FLIGHT;But now, wait a minute. Before we do any of that, I want to hear what it is,control configuration we're going to be in, and whether we can keep the PGNS up,or whether we're going to bring the AGS up, etc.;CONTROL
54598.8;CONTROL;Okay.;FLIGHT
54599.8;FLIGHT;I want to get the holes dug before we start doing more things to this.;CONTROL
54602.8;CONTROL;Roger.;FLIGHT
54604.8;FLIGHT;Let me see if - have you heard that one of the suggestions is to align the AGS,to the PGNS, power the PGNS down, use the AGS, and then bring the PGNS back up,and do a P52 for the burn?;CONTROL
54617.8;CONTROL;That's right, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
54618.8;CDR;Completed, Houston.;CAPCOM
54620.8;FLIGHT;Okay. Well, I'd like to get that whole complex of control modes and what we're,going to do in currents sorted out before we do start changing things.;CONTROL
54621.8;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. Thank you.;CDR
54625.8;CONTROL;Okay.;FLIGHT
54626.8;FLIGHT;Or we'll be doing this all night. Okay, Hal?;CONTROL
54629.8;CONTROL;Roger.;FLIGHT
54630.8;FLIGHT;And I'm open to any suggestions here as to what the reasonable course of action,- the last I heard from -;CONTROL

54889.8;GUIDO;That's right. So, we're having them run it on the hybrid, and check it out -;FLIGHT
54892.8;FLIGHT;The REFSMMAT - I'm not - GUIDANCE, say one more time why you want them to have,a REFSMMAT, because he doesn't have one -;GUIDO

55035.8;CONTROL;Go ahead, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
55036.8;FLIGHT;Did he cycle the valves on the ascent feed? Jack says he did it.;CONTROL
55039.8;CONTROL;Okay, we can't see that he did it, FLIGHT, on TM.;FLIGHT
55041.8;FLIGHT;Okay, but he did do it.;CONTROL
55042.8;CONTROL;Okay, fine, thank you.;FLIGHT
55044.8;FLIGHT;Okay. He cycled the ascent feeds - -;CONTROL
55051.8;FLIGHT;Okay, now, we're working on what we're going to do with the configuration. We,need to get some kind of PTC going for us here, and we need to decide what we,want to do with our control configuration - you're working all that, huh,,CONTROL?;CONTROL
55062.8;CONTROL;Trying my best to, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT

55370.8;FLIGHT;Go.;GUIDO
55371.8;GUIDO;We're through COMMANDing to the LM.;FLIGHT
55372.8;FLIGHT;Through COMMANDing, CAPCOM.;GUIDO
55376.8;TELMU;FLIGHT, TELMU.;FLIGHT
55377.8;FLIGHT;Go.;TELMU
55378.8;TELMU;I'd like to go ahead and get that DUA off the line.;FLIGHT
55380.8;FLIGHT;Okay. We're through COMMANDing, CAPCOM, and they can take that circuit breaker,- the DUA circuit breaker out again.;TELMU
55385.8;TELMU;And FLIGHT, TELMU.;FLIGHT
55386.8;FLIGHT;Go.;TELMU
55388.8;TELMU;We'd like to get as much gear off here as we can. We'd like for you to think,about turning this inverter off.;FLIGHT
55393.8;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. We're finished with the uplink. The computer is yours. We'd like to power down the DUA, so pull the DUA circuit breaker please.;LMP
55395.8;FLIGHT;Again, here? Which inverter?;TELMU
55397.8;TELMU;The LM inverter. Inverter 2.;FLIGHT
55399.8;FLIGHT;It's running the eight-ball. Yeah, I need to tie that together with how we're,going to fly this thing, Merlin - I'm waiting to get this whole thing.;TELMU
55404.8;LMP; Okay. Updata link breaker is coming Open.;CAPCOM
55405.8;LMP;Okay. Updata link breaker's coming OPEN.;CAPCOM
55407.8;TELMU;Understand, but -;FLIGHT
55408.8;FLIGHT;I understand what you're saying.;TELMU
55409.8;TELMU;Okay.;FLIGHT
55410.8;FLIGHT;How many amps are we taking with that?;TELMU
55412.8;TELMU;Well, we're pulling about 2 amps.;FLIGHT
55414.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;TELMU
55415.8;TELMU;Every little bit helps.;FLIGHT
55416.8;FLIGHT;Well, I know. I agree with you.;TELMU
55419.8;TELMU;Let me get -;FLIGHT
55420.8;FLIGHT;Let me - ah, okay.;TELMU
55422.8;TELMU;The water rate right now, we're pulling about 7 pounds per hour. And at current,capabilities, about 34 hours. Descent water.;FLIGHT
55432.8;FLIGHT;Say again?;TELMU
55433.8;TELMU;About 34 hours on the descent water at the present rate.;FLIGHT
55442.8;FLIGHT;Oh, okay. Okay, but we should be able to take the PGNS and and the IMU off -;TELMU
55445.8;TELMU;That's right.;FLIGHT
55446.8;FLIGHT;#NAAM?;TELMU
55460.8;FLIGHT;Okay. I'd like to get everybody up here a minute. RETRO, GUIDANCE, CONTROL,,TELMU, GNC and EECOM, and CAPCOM. INCO and FAO. Is everybody on the loop, give,me an amber, please.;ALL
55475.8;FLIGHT;RETRO, you up?;RETRO
55479.8;FLIGHT;GUIDANCE, get a RETRO up in the loop, will you please?;RETRO
55480.8;RETRO;Go ahead.;FLIGHT
55482.8;FLIGHT;Look. As I see it, we've got a number of things to do. No big hurry right now.,We've gotta maintain COMM here, of course, with the LM. But we need to see what,we need to do about setting up a PTC attitude and an arrange - a control mode.,And what that means relative to the AGS and the PGNS configuration as to,powering the AGS down, etc. Now, CONTROL, you're working that problem, right?;CONTROL
55507.8;CONTROL;Roger.;FLIGHT
55513.8;FLIGHT;And I'm proceeding now just staying put until we get that whole story put,together - and how long is it going to take you, do you think, to come to some,conclusion on that, Hal?;CONTROL
55522.8;CONTROL;I don't have an estimate right now, FLIGHT. We're trying to get it to you as,soon as -;FLIGHT
55525.8;FLIGHT;About an hour?;CONTROL
55526.8;CONTROL;Yeah.;FLIGHT
55527.8;FLIGHT;Alright. Now, so - so we'll just standby on that. We are interested, though, in,this also from the point of view of the power configuration. TELMU, I assume,you're working out all the consumable options, and as soon as CONTROL's got a,mode here you're going to be able to lay out a power profile to tell us where,we stand on all your Oâ‚‚, and your water, and your power, right?;TELMU
55551.8;TELMU;Wilco.;FLIGHT
55552.8;FLIGHT;But can you say something generally, now? Generally, we can come all the way,home at 25 amps, right? On the LM?;TELMU
55560.8;TELMU;Not with this water usage right now, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
55563.8;FLIGHT;No, but if we go down to 25 amps all of that will help us, won't it?;TELMU
55568.8;FLIGHT;Oh, I see what you're saying. 25 amps - not much.;TELMU
55570.8;TELMU;Yeah, that's not going to help us that much, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
55573.8;FLIGHT;Okay. Well, what do we have to get down to? For example?;TELMU
55580.8;TELMU;Standby - I would think about 15 amps or so.;FLIGHT
55582.8;FLIGHT;From the point of view of the water then we've got to get down that low -;TELMU
55584.8;TELMU;Yeah. About 15, I think.;FLIGHT
55587.8;FLIGHT;Can we do that? In a life support/COMM mode?;TELMU
55590.8;TELMU;Say again, FLIGHT?;FLIGHT
55591.8;FLIGHT;We could be at 15 amps in a life support/COMM mode, could we not?;TELMU
55594.8;TELMU;That's affirmative.;FLIGHT
55595.8;FLIGHT;Alright. Now, we need to figure out something also for your COâ‚‚ scrubbing,,right?;TELMU
55599.8;TELMU;Right.;FLIGHT
55600.8;FLIGHT;And - and EECOM needs to know how he's going to do that over in his vehicle if,we have to get into that. I've got a note up here that I don't quite,understand, it says LM LiOH is 48 man-hours. That doesn't sound quite right to,me.;TELMU
55615.8;TELMU;That's on the cartridge - standby, we'll get you consumables.;FLIGHT
55620.8;FLIGHT;"Alright. But TELMU, I'd like some people to start running consumable profiles,out, making a couple of different assumptions and not standing by, waiting for,everything - and please have somebody run it out grossly, you know, so that we,continue to have at least a story even though it's not the most accurate one;,you can continue to refine it as you go along.";TELMU
55639.8;TELMU;Roger.;FLIGHT
55640.8;FLIGHT;I'd like to relatively soon here get some idea how we stand and what we're -,boxes we're running into and when we've got to start deciding things, okay?;TELMU
55647.8;TELMU;Wilco.;FLIGHT
55649.8;FLIGHT;Okay, does anybody have anything else besides those areas that they want to,bring to our attention right now?;ALL
55656.8;INCO;INC - FLIGHT, INCO.;FLIGHT
55657.8;FLIGHT;Yes. INCO.;INCO
55658.8;INCO;If we can get that change done, where we get some tracking data for FDO, we'd,hope. If you'll let us drop the uplink and the downlink from the LM for about,25 seconds.;FLIGHT
55667.8;FLIGHT;And then re-establish it?;INCO
55669.8;INCO;Right.;FLIGHT
55671.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;INCO
55672.8;INCO;We'd like you to alert the crew that they're not going to have contact for a,few seconds.;FLIGHT
55674.8;FLIGHT;Okay. Let me go around, Ed, and then we'll pick that up. Does anybody have,anything else? Let me go around the room. Trench - RETRO? FDO? GUIDANCE?;GUIDO
55684.8;GUIDO;Negative, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
55685.8;FLIGHT;GUIDANCE, you okay? Well, go back green then, please. CONTROL, you got anything,else?;CONTROL
55688.8;CONTROL;Negative, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
55689.8;FLIGHT;Okay. TELMU?;TELMU
55692.8;TELMU;Negative, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
55693.8;FLIGHT;Okay. I want to start hearing from you, TELMU, on these consumables.;TELMU
55695.8;TELMU;Say again, FLIGHT?;FLIGHT
55696.8;FLIGHT;I want to start hearing from you as you get some -;TELMU
55698.8;TELMU;Roger. We're cranking.;FLIGHT
55700.8;FLIGHT;Okay, go back green, then. GNC?;TELMU
55702.8;GNC;Negative, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
55703.8;FLIGHT;EECOM?;EECOM
55704.8;EECOM;Negative.;FLIGHT
55705.8;FLIGHT;Green, please. CAPCOM, Jack, can you think of anything we ought to be working,on other than those mentioned?;CAPCOM
55710.8;CAPCOM;I didn't get all you mentioned, but are we working on bringing the AGS up?;FLIGHT
55714.8;FLIGHT;Yeah, that's a possibility, you know? As to whether we gotta do that for the,PTC, and do what Tom suggested here.;CAPCOM
55722.8;CAPCOM;Well, we could bring it up and have it there, and it'd be a good idea to make,sure it's working.;FLIGHT
55727.8;FLIGHT;Yeah. I just don't want to use any more power right now, or any more water.;CAPCOM
55731.8;CAPCOM;Okay.;FLIGHT
55733.8;FLIGHT;As soon as we know a little more about what we really ought to do, then we'll,proceed to spend the consumables to do that. Anything else that you can think,of?;CAPCOM
55742.8;CAPCOM;I'd like to have a little more information upon the crew's trajectory with,relation to the Moon that we could pass up.;FLIGHT
55749.8;FLIGHT;Yes, and INCO is gonna - at the end of this go-around the room, we're going to,ask the crew to standby for about 25 seconds of COMM loss while we do some,reconfiguring in an attempt to get tracking on the LM. Okay? But we still think,they're still close - FDO, FLIGHT? What -;FDO
55767.8;FDO;Go, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
55768.8;FLIGHT;What closest approach are you estimating right now on the LM?;FDO
55772.8;FDO;Still looking at about 60 miles, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
55773.8;FLIGHT;You're still looking at 60, Jack.;FDO
55775.8;CAPCOM;60 miles.;FLIGHT
55776.8;FLIGHT;Yeah.;CAPCOM
55777.8;CAPCOM;And -;FLIGHT
55778.8;FLIGHT;"And this COMM thing we're going through is to try to re-establish tracking on,the LM; right now, we don't have tracking.";CAPCOM
55785.8;CAPCOM;Okay, thank you.;FLIGHT
55786.8;FLIGHT;You can go back green, then, if you will. Okay - SURGEON, you have anything?;SURGEON
55789.8;SURGEON;Yeah, two things. We're figuring, looking at this COâ‚‚ problem with you - at,what point in time we'd arrive at various levels of COâ‚‚ in the LM,configuration. The other thing is, Glynn, we - at some point in time we'd like,to get that BIOMED switch on in the LM - it's in the OFF position.;FLIGHT
55810.8;FLIGHT;Okay. Okay, you want to go back green, then? INCO, anything besides that COMM -;SURGEON
55821.8;FLIGHT;INCO, anything else? Go back green, then. AFD?;AFD
55824.8;AFD;Negative, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
55826.8;FLIGHT;FAO, you have anything you're working on - that's stowage, right?;FAO
55829.8;FAO;That's affirmative, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
55830.8;FLIGHT;Any suggestions we might have as to what they might move to the LM, or move to,the CSM.;FAO
55834.8;FAO;That's right. We're working on that. I think it'll be minimal anyway.;FLIGHT
55838.8;FLIGHT;Okay. And NETWORK, you got anything?;NETWORK
55841.8;NETWORK;Well, we hope to have Honeysuckle 210 up by 62 hours for voice only.;FLIGHT
55846.8;FLIGHT;Okay.;NETWORK
55847.8;NETWORK;We hope to have them up by then.;FLIGHT
55849.8;FLIGHT;Okay. RECOVERY? You got anything?;RECOVERY
55852.8;RECOVERY;Negative, FLIGHT. Present efforts are to identify ships on the Atlantic and the,Indian Ocean.;FLIGHT
55856.8;FLIGHT;Okay. NETWORK, you want to go back green, then? Okay, there are the subjects,,and we need to start getting some - closed out on some of them here, gentlemen.,So. Let us bend our efforts to get that done.;NETWORK
55874.8;INCO;Got a GO, FLIGHT?;FLIGHT
55875.8;FLIGHT;Yeah. CAPCOM, would you call the crew and tell them we're going to drop COMM,for half a minute here while we try to establish tracking?;CAPCOM
55883.8;CAPCOM;Okay.;FLIGHT
55884.8;FLIGHT;And let them know that our best estimate of the EC's got a 60 mile perigee,right now.;CAPCOM
55888.8;INCO;And FLIGHT, if you'll confirm AFT OMNI.;FLIGHT
55891.8;FLIGHT;And you want AFT OMNI?;INCO
55892.8;INCO;Affirm.;FLIGHT
55893.8;FLIGHT;Okay. Got that, CAPCOM?;CAPCOM
55895.8;CAPCOM;Aquarius, Houston. We'd like to have AFT OMNI, and we're going to lose contact,with you for about a minute here while we try to establish tracking. And our,latest data shows that your closest approach to the Moon is going to be 60,miles perigee, over.;LMP
55914.8;LMP;Okay. Closest approach, 60 miles, and I'm sitting on AFT OMNI now.;CAPCOM
55920.8;CAPCOM; Roger. We'll probably be going off the air here in about a minute.;LMP
55930.8;FLIGHT;Okay, INCO. We've told them. Go ahead.;INCO
55932.8;INCO;Thank you, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
55936.4;CDR; Houston, Aquarius. Over.;CAPCOM
55938.4;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CDR
55943.4;CDR; Okay. We're thinking about rigging up the urine dump to the side hatch. We're thinking about rigging up the urine dump to the side hatch and save urine heater power. What do you think?;CAPCOM
55953.4;CDR;We're thinking about rigging up the urine dump to the side hatch to save urine,heater power. What do you think?;CAPCOM
55960.4;CAPCOM; Stand by one.;CDR
55962.4;FLIGHT;EECOM, you copy that?;EECOM
55963.4;EECOM;That sounds okay here, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
55964.4;FLIGHT;Okay with us, Jack.;EECOM
55966.4;CDR; Better still so we won't freeze up our urine dump.;CAPCOM
55967.4;CDR;Or better still so we can - won't freeze up our urine dump.;CAPCOM
55971.4;EECOM;We agree with all of that.;FLIGHT
55972.4;CAPCOM;Roger, that sounds like a good plan, Jim. Why don't you go ahead with that one?;CDR
55979.4;FLIGHT;CAPCOM, FLIGHT.;CAPCOM
55980.4;CAPCOM;Go, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
55981.4;FLIGHT;As a matter of fact, Jack, why don't you let them know that we're currently -,since it's so quiet from here - trying to figure out what's the best,configuration to do here relative to maintaining control, maintaining some kind,of PTC, staying in the posture that we can do the burn properly, and playing,that against the consumables. And as soon as we get a reasonably coherent story,we'll brief them in full on it. Okay?;CAPCOM
56008.4;CAPCOM;Okay. How about - are we getting a flight plan worked out, modified, so forth?;FLIGHT
56015.4;FAO;We are working on that, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
56016.4;FLIGHT;Yeah, working on it. And you might also tell them that we've got Gene Cernan,and the guys over in the simulator checking stars, etc, in this configuration.;CAPCOM
56026.4;CAPCOM;Okay.;FLIGHT
56027.4;FLIGHT;And anything that they would like us to run, we can proceed to do it.;CAPCOM
56043.4;CAPCOM;Okay, Aquarius. Down here we're getting regrouped, trying to work on your,control modes and trying to set up something for PTC and taking a look at,consumables as opposed to flight plan, and so forth. And as soon as we get all,that information, we'll pass it up to you. We also have the 14 backup crew over,in the simulators looking at docked burns and also trying to see what kind of,alignment procedures they can come up with for looking at stars out the window.,So if you ever are able to see any stars out there and think you can do an,alignment out the window, why let us know.;CDR
56045.4;TELMU;FLIGHT, TELMU.;FLIGHT
56047.4;FLIGHT;TELMU, let me hear the COMM. Okay? Can we hear it? Do you need something?;TELMU
56052.4;TELMU;We've got to power down, here, pretty quick.;FLIGHT
56054.4;FLIGHT;Okay. TELMU, go.;TELMU
56058.4;TELMU;We ought to - recommend turning the power off - POWER AMPL off, going to LOW,BIT RATE, and getting his AC off, and probably bringing the AGS up on standby.;FLIGHT
56074.4;FLIGHT;Okay. What consumable are you running into trouble with, TELMU?;TELMU
56077.4;TELMU;Water and electric power.;FLIGHT
56081.4;FLIGHT;Okay. Can you relate some facts to me, here?;TELMU
56084.4;CDR; Okay. Jack, right now we're not able to. The sunlight's reflecting off the thrusters and whatever debris came away at the time of the mishap is still with us, such that the stars are hard to find, and why - what respect do you want us to do the stars out the window - just to check the LMS run, is that correct?;CAPCOM
56086.4;TELMU;Like I said, the water is - present rate, we've only got 34 hours left.;FLIGHT
56099.4;FLIGHT;Go ahead. Power?;TELMU
56102.4;TELMU;Standby 1.;FLIGHT
56108.4;CAPCOM;That's affirm. We'd like to correlate what information we get with yours, so,that if we can use it to update the platform, we can.;CDR
56121.4;TELMU;Okay, the power is 67.5 hours, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
56124.4;CAPCOM; What we're really trying to do, Jim, is see if we can do a COAS align so we can power down the platform. [Long pause.];CDR
56125.4;FLIGHT;Is that ascent and descent?;TELMU
56126.4;CAPCOM;What we're really trying to do, Jim, is see if we can do a COAS align so we can,power down the platform.;CDR
56127.4;TELMU;That's affirm.;FLIGHT
56128.4;FLIGHT;At the present load, is that right?.;TELMU
56129.4;TELMU;That's right.;FLIGHT
56134.4;TELMU;That's what I - I think we just need to get some things powered down ASAP.;FLIGHT
56138.4;FLIGHT;Okay. Now what are you suggesting, again?;TELMU
56140.4;TELMU;I'm suggesting POWER AMPL -;FLIGHT
56142.4;FLIGHT;POWER AMPL. How much does that save?;TELMU
56143.4;TELMU;- and LOW BIT RATE - that's about 2.5 amps.;FLIGHT
56147.4;FLIGHT;Alright.;TELMU
56150.4;TELMU;And the AC, which is about 2 amps.;FLIGHT
56152.4;FLIGHT;"Well, that loses his ball; then we don't have anything. Right? I mean, we don't,have the data on the ground - do you have IMU data on the LOW BIT RATE there,,CONTROL?";CONTROL
56162.4;CONTROL;All we'd have is resolvers. It's good enough.;FLIGHT
56165.4;FLIGHT;You can watch it?;CONTROL
56166.4;CONTROL;Yeah, we can watch the gimbal angle.;FLIGHT
56167.4;FLIGHT;What control mode is he in now?;CONTROL
56169.4;CONTROL;He's in PGNS MIN IMPULSE.;FLIGHT
56170.4;FLIGHT;So he's still flying it around.;CONTROL
56172.4;CONTROL;Yes.;FLIGHT
56177.4;FLIGHT;I think it's kind of difficult to talk them through, isn't it?;CONTROL
56184.4;FLIGHT;He'd have to bring the ball up to fly it, I'd think.;CONTROL
56187.4;TELMU;Well, my thought on that a while ago, FLIGHT, was if he goes to an ATTITUDE,HOLD mode now, and out of this drifting flight mode, he'll hold the attitude,he's in now.;FLIGHT
56188.4;LMP; That is Aquarius. We're getting an awful lot of static on the uplink now, and we're not reading you at all. [Pause.];CAPCOM
56189.4;CDR;Houston, Aquarius. We're getting an awful lot of static on the uplink now, and,we're not reading you at all.;CAPCOM
56192.4;CONTROL;Okay, then you don't have to worry about it.;FLIGHT
56194.4;FLIGHT;Was that what you want to start - recommend, and EECO - TELMU's getting in a,hurry, here.;CONTROL
56200.4;CONTROL;Yeah, well, I don't blame him.;FLIGHT
56201.4;CAPCOM;What's going on with the COMMs, FLIGHT?;FLIGHT
56202.4;FLIGHT;I don't know.;CAPCOM
56203.4;LMP; I have good signal strength and I'm on Aft Omni.;CAPCOM
56211.4;FLIGHT;What else, TELMU, have you got anything else to suggest?;TELMU
56214.4;TELMU;Negative, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
56215.4;CAPCOM;How do you read now, Aquarius?;CDR
56217.4;FLIGHT;CONTROL, FLIGHT.;CONTROL
56218.4;CONTROL;Go ahead.;FLIGHT
56219.4;FLIGHT;Now, how about you? What can you do to help? What do we need to do to decide,whether to go to the AGS or not, here?;CONTROL
56227.4;CONTROL;Well -;FLIGHT
56228.4;FLIGHT;Do we know whether or not the - results of this star business in the simulator,worked?;CONTROL
56232.4;CONTROL;That was a request I've got in to SPAN, to extrapolate the measured drift rates,on this particular platform to see what it would look like when we got out to,79.5 hours.;FLIGHT
56243.4;FLIGHT;Okay. But if we can see stars, we can do a P52.;CONTROL
56246.4;CONTROL;Yes, if he can see the stars, then that kind of falls out, you know? And if,that - if he can do a 52 align we'd definitely recommend to transfer the,alignment into the AGS and turn the AGS on, turn the PGNS down.;FLIGHT
56258.4;FLIGHT;CAPCOM, FLIGHT.;CAPCOM
56259.4;CAPCOM;Go.;FLIGHT
56260.4;FLIGHT;What are you getting out of the star sighting discussions?;CAPCOM
56263.4;CAPCOM;Well, the last thing I heard was that the sunlight reflected off the thrusters,- made it so as they couldn't see the stars and they also had a lot of debris,still floating around with them, so they are unable to -;FLIGHT
56273.4;FLIGHT;Couldn't see them out of what? Out of the window? Or out of the AOT?;CAPCOM
56278.4;CAPCOM;Out of the window.;FLIGHT
56279.4;FLIGHT;Have they tried the AOT yet, do you know? The reason I'm asking is that we're,running low on water. I mean, we're going to run out of water in 34 hours at,the current power level.;CAPCOM
56290.4;CDR; Hey, Jim, do you suppose that you could orient the LM so that the Service Module would be between you and the Sun? I believe you could see - recognize constellations out your front windows then. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
56318.4;FLIGHT;How about going to LOW BIT RATE? The POWER AMPL OFF and the LOW BIT RATE?,CONTROL? Can you do that now?;CONTROL
56322.4;CONTROL;That's fine, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
56323.4;FLIGHT;GUIDANCE, can you do that now?;GUIDO
56325.4;GUIDO;Roger, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
56327.4;FLIGHT;INCO, okay with you?;INCO
56329.4;FLIGHT;INCO?;INCO
56330.4;INCO;Say again, FLIGHT?;FLIGHT
56331.4;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Radio check. [Long pause.];CDR
56333.4;FLIGHT;Okay with you if we turn the POWER AMPL OFF and go to LOW BIT RATE?;INCO
56335.4;INCO;Well, why don't you let us get ourselves swung in, here, and see how we're,going to work out with this problem? We're -;FLIGHT
56339.4;FLIGHT;What just happened?;INCO
56340.4;INCO;- in the midst of that procedure, there.;FLIGHT
56341.4;FLIGHT;Oh, okay. You're still in the middle of that.;INCO
56342.4;INCO;Right.;FLIGHT
56343.4;FLIGHT;Okay.;INCO
56344.4;CAPCOM;I don't have any COMM with them, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
56348.4;FLIGHT;INCO, FLIGHT. Do we have no uplink right now?;INCO
56353.4;FLIGHT;How come? We still - I thought that was only going to take 30 seconds.;INCO
56358.4;CDR;Okay, Jack. How do you read now?;CAPCOM
56361.4;CAPCOM;Okay. Hearing you 5 square now, Jim. And the question we have, is there some way you can orient the spacecraft so that the Service Module is between the LM and the Sun so you can recognize constellations out the window? And secondly, can you see anything out the AOT? [Long pause.];LMP
56384.4;INCO;FLIGHT, INCO. I don't think he's got an uplink COMM mode right now.;FLIGHT
56387.4;FLIGHT;Well, can we get one?;INCO
56388.4;INCO;Yeah, he's coming through right in that spot that I told you about, there.,We're trying to force that lock now, and as soon as we get it we'll give you a,call.;FLIGHT
56395.4;FLIGHT;Okay.;INCO
56396.4;CAPCOM;Are we tracking them yet, FLIGHT?;FLIGHT
56398.4;INCO;For reference, going to POWER AMPL OFF on an OMNI in LOW BIT RATE -;FLIGHT
56401.4;FLIGHT;Wait a minute, wait a minute, Ed. The CAPCOM wants to know when we're going to,have COMM. Is it coming back shortly?;INCO
56407.4;INCO;I'll give you a call. It'll be back shortly.;FLIGHT
56409.4;FLIGHT;Alright. Okay, now the POWER AMPL.;INCO
56411.4;INCO;"If we turn the POWER AMPL OFF, go to LOW BIT RATE and stay on an OMNI, if we go,to DOWN VOICE BACKUP; we may be able to make it. It'll be very close.";FLIGHT
56420.4;FLIGHT;Make what?;INCO
56421.4;INCO;Voice.;FLIGHT
56423.4;FLIGHT;Up or down?;INCO
56424.4;INCO;Both.;FLIGHT
56427.4;INCO;It's going to be marginal.;FLIGHT
56432.4;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?;LMP
56434.4;INCO;I'd like to give it a try, though.;FLIGHT
56437.4;FLIGHT;Okay, well let's finish up your test. Are you finished with that test?;INCO
56439.4;INCO;No, they're not quite finished yet. Standby.;FLIGHT
56476.4;FLIGHT;TELMU, FLIGHT.;TELMU
56478.4;TELMU;Go, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
56479.4;FLIGHT;Merlin, I've got your problem, and I appreciate your concern. Right now we're,trying to get the COMM back - we kind of have to get his assessment of this,thing to see whether we can bring the PGNS down now.;TELMU
56490.4;TELMU;Okay. What about the AC? Did - you still kicking that around?;FLIGHT
56494.4;FLIGHT;Well, that's a problem. I don't know what we're going to do for PTC yet. I'm,waiting for CONTROL. Without the - we can't just sit there in ATTITUDE HOLD.,And I don't know about setting up a PTC in the LM.;TELMU
56508.4;TELMU;Okay.;FLIGHT
56518.4;FLIGHT;CONTROL, FLIGHT.;CONTROL
56520.4;CONTROL;Go ahead, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
56521.4;FLIGHT;Are his attitudes moving around some? Or is he essentially fixed?;CONTROL
56525.4;CONTROL;Essentially static in attitude.;FLIGHT
56529.4;CONTROL;He's moving just a little bit but not a heck of a lot.;FLIGHT
56562.4;TELMU;FLIGHT, TELMU.;FLIGHT
56563.4;FLIGHT;Suit - go ahead.;TELMU
56565.4;TELMU;This ASCENT TANK 2 pressure has gone back down to a nominal value. We'd like to,go back to the DESCENT Oâ‚‚.;FLIGHT
56572.4;FLIGHT;Okay.;TELMU
56573.4;TELMU;Close TANK 2 and open DESCENT TANK.;FLIGHT
56575.4;FLIGHT;Okay. CAP - INCO, are we anywhere near back in COMM yet?;INCO
56580.4;INCO;FLIGHT, if you just hang on a couple of more seconds here, maybe we can get,this thing squared away so we get the tracking data that the FDO needs. That's,what we're after, here.;FLIGHT
56588.4;FLIGHT;I understand that.;INCO
56589.4;INCO;No, we're not - we don't have a good COMM mode at this time.;FLIGHT
56591.4;FLIGHT;Alright.;INCO
56593.4;FLIGHT;CAPCOM, when you get COMM back, we can go back to DESCENT Oâ‚‚. You got that,,Jack?;CAPCOM
56618.4;FLIGHT;Is it the same procedure?;CAPCOM
56637.4;FLIGHT;GNC and CONTROL, FLIGHT.;CONTROL
56641.4;CONTROL;CONTROL here.;FLIGHT
56642.4;FLIGHT;Is somebody working me out a PTC procedure?;CONTROL
56644.4;CONTROL;Yeah, we're trying to get pulled together. We've got one for the AGS right now,,FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
56647.4;FLIGHT;Okay.;CONTROL
56670.4;INCO;FLIGHT, INCO.;FLIGHT
56671.4;FLIGHT;Go ahead.;INCO
56672.4;INCO;It looks like we're getting it slowly, here. We're just about there. As soon as,you get it, we'd like to go to FORWARD OMNI.;FLIGHT
56678.4;FLIGHT;Okay.;INCO
56690.4;CAPCOM; Aquarius, how do you read me now?;LMP
56716.4;FLIGHT;TELMU, FLIGHT.;TELMU
56717.4;TELMU;Go, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
56718.4;FLIGHT;Merlin, how many amps are we using with the LGC and the IMU?;TELMU
56721.4;TELMU;Just about 12 amps.;FLIGHT
56722.4;FLIGHT;Total?;TELMU
56723.4;TELMU;Yeah.;FLIGHT
56729.4;TELMU;It's 10 amps, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
56731.4;FLIGHT;Total. So we still have about 20 amps, huh?;TELMU
56733.4;TELMU;Yeah.;FLIGHT
56736.4;FLIGHT;But they're the - they would be the big coolant items, wouldn't they?;TELMU
56739.4;TELMU;Yeah -;FLIGHT
56740.4;FLIGHT;That ought to improve the coolant picture a heck of a lot more than 30 percent.;TELMU
56742.4;TELMU;Yup.;FLIGHT
56802.4;FLIGHT;INCO, can we talk yet?;INCO
56806.4;NETWORK;That's a negative, FLIGHT. There's no uplink.;FLIGHT
56810.4;FLIGHT;INCO, have I got an estimate?;INCO
56813.4;INCO;FLIGHT, let me tell you what's happened. While we were trying to lock it up,,we've drifted around into FORWARD OMNI country. So right now we're in FORWARD,OMNI, we've got AFT selected, and he doesn't know because -;FLIGHT
56823.4;FLIGHT;How so?;INCO
56824.4;INCO;- he has his display breaker pulled. So if I can bear on your indulgence to,wait until we swing all the way around to the AFT OMNI, then we can get this -;FLIGHT
56830.4;FLIGHT;We're not exactly swinging, you know?;INCO
56832.4;INCO;Yes, we are, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
56833.4;FLIGHT;Are we? We moving around?;INCO

57525.4;CAPCOM;Still want FORWARD OMNI?;FLIGHT
57526.4;TELMU;Well, it's about - about 3 amps, but primarily the AGS does run a little,cooler, and you'd be bringing up a new piece of gear. So, it'd be a different,thermal load, there.;FLIGHT

57566.4;INCO;That's what they're trying to do. We're not having any luck. There's one,suggestion we can do. We can turn the LM transceiver completely off for about 2,to 3 minutes, and let them grab ahold of the S-IVB, push it out of the way, and,then bring it back up.;FLIGHT
57582.4;FLIGHT;Is that what we have to do now? We can't talk to them to tell them to do that.;INCO
57584.4;INCO;"Well. That's right. But if we can get up ?? here, just say: ""turn your,transceiver off for 3 minutes. Then turn it back on."" And I'll try to give you,a call if I think you can get through.";FLIGHT
57599.4;FLIGHT;Okay.;INCO
57604.4;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;LMP

57625.4;FLIGHT;For 3 minutes.;INCO
57632.4;CAPCOM;You want S-BAND XMTR/RCVR OFF?;FLIGHT
57635.4;FLIGHT;Is that our best step here, INCO?;INCO

57645.4;FLIGHT;INCO, FLIGHT.;INCO
57646.4;INCO;Go ahead.;FLIGHT
57647.4;FLIGHT;Is that our best step now to get COMM back?;INCO
57649.4;INCO;That's our best step. Right.;FLIGHT
57651.4;FLIGHT;CAPCOM, give them that. We'll try.;CAPCOM
57652.4;INCO;He's not going to hear you, FLIGHT, right now.;FLIGHT
57672.4;FLIGHT;CONTROL, FLIGHT.;CONTROL
57673.4;CONTROL;Go ahead.;FLIGHT
57674.4;FLIGHT;Now, how close are you to having this thing - you're proposing an AGS PTC mode,and a -;CONTROL
57680.4;CONTROL;Well, we just got input - what I'm going to do you - with right now, is a,procedure for turning the AGS on and aligning it to the PGNS, so we can turn,the PGNS off.;FLIGHT
57687.4;FLIGHT;Yes.;CONTROL
57688.4;CONTROL;And that'll leave us in an AGS ATTITUDE HOLD mode.;FLIGHT
57690.4;FLIGHT;Yes.;CONTROL
57691.4;CONTROL;And I just got word from SPAN, the procedure we had for the PTC in AGS, Carlton,Hanaway has been, he's - it's not going to work. He's working feverishly to get,one that will. Just got that input.;FLIGHT
57714.4;FLIGHT;Okay.;CONTROL
57715.4;CAPCOM;Do you recommend we simulate this procedure over in the LMS before we ship it,up?;FLIGHT
57721.4;FLIGHT;Which procedure, Jack? What we're proposing is an AGS ATTITUDE HOLD that we,change periodically.;CAPCOM
57729.4;FLIGHT;Since they don't have a PTC, as such, that works.;CAPCOM
57732.4;CAPCOM;Well, that's what I mean -;FLIGHT
57733.4;FLIGHT;Yes.;CAPCOM
57734.4;CAPCOM;- we've got a procedure that will give us PTC in AGS, try it in the simulator,first.;FLIGHT
57738.4;FLIGHT;They - they don't have a procedure to get a PTC in AGS. They had one -;CAPCOM
57741.4;CONTROL;We had one -;FLIGHT
57742.4;LMP;Okay. Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?;CAPCOM
57744.4;FLIGHT;- it doesn't work.;CONTROL
57745.4;CONTROL;- but it doesn't work. Somebody thinks it won't, so we're not going to try it.,Unless you want to try that one in the simulator.;FLIGHT
57747.4;CAPCOM;Okay.;CONTROL
57749.4;CONTROL;I would say no on that.;CAPCOM
57837.4;FLIGHT;INCO, sing out as soon as you think we've got COMM over there, will you please?;INCO
57840.4;INCO;Yes sir.;FLIGHT
57842.4;FLIGHT;What are we doing now?;INCO
57844.4;INCO;They're trying to bring up an uplink carrier to the LM so we can get some voice,to them.;FLIGHT
57876.4;FDO;FLIGHT, FDO.;FLIGHT
57877.4;FLIGHT;Go ahead.;FDO
57878.4;FDO;I'll bring you up to speed on what I've been doing down here.;FLIGHT
57880.4;FLIGHT;Say again?;FDO
57881.4;FDO;I'll bring you up to speed on what I've been doing down here. Looking at a,maneuver in the vicini - in the present time range, and on the vector that I've,got now, looking at about 16 feet per second to get free-return.;FLIGHT
57893.4;FLIGHT;"Yeah; that's what I'm hearing over here in my other ear, Bill.";FDO
57895.4;FDO;Alright. And, I've got some selects down here working on a vector right now.,This is on the CSM doppler after the glitches.;FLIGHT
57903.4;FLIGHT;Mmhmm.;FDO
57904.4;FDO;And we're not sure whether it's going to be any better than what we've got now.;FLIGHT
57907.4;FLIGHT;Uh huh.;FDO
57908.4;FDO;"So, I guess what I've got to say is that in about 10 minutes, I can have a,maneuver ready - I'll be able to compute a maneuver; time range of 61:30. And,we can make our decision with that - âˆ†V will be around, like I said, about 16,or 17 feet per second.";FLIGHT
57924.4;FLIGHT;And that's a free-return.;FDO

58031.4;FDO;Roger that. I can. It's just a question of which vector we want to do it on,,FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
58035.4;FLIGHT;Well, get one at 61 on the best vector you have.;FDO

58187.4;TELMU;About 230.;FLIGHT

58192.4;TELMU;Yeah, right, I think we gotta keep it up.;FLIGHT
58194.4;FLIGHT;Okay.;TELMU
58195.4;TELMU;Get into free return and then power it down -;FLIGHT
58196.4;FLIGHT;Yup. Then power it down, let it drift, and we'll do what we want to tomorrow.;TELMU

58438.4;CDR; Okay, we're reading you loud and clear, Jack. I hope it stays this time.;CAPCOM
58442.4;CAPCOM;Okay. We'd like to brief you on what our plan is. We're, at this time, water critical in the LM. So we'd like to use as little as possible. To do this, we're going to plan to make a free return maneuver of 16 feet per second at 61 hours, which is 37 minutes from now. Then we're going to power down the PGNS, and then we'll - at 79 hours, we'll go ahead and make another abort maneuver to kick what we got. But we'd like to get that PGNS powered down as soon as possible. That would be after the midcourse and - so how do you feel about making a 16-foot-per-second burn in 37 minutes?;CDR
58471.4;FLIGHT;Figure something out.;ALL
58481.4;FLIGHT;After the midcourse.;ALL
58483.4;CAPCOM;That would be after the midcourse and - so, how do you feel about making a 16,foot-per-second burn in 37 minutes?;CDR
58493.4;CDR;Well we'll give it a try, Jack, if that's all we've got. That's a 16,foot-per-second DPS burn in 37 minutes?;CAPCOM
58501.4;CAPCOM;Roger. We're working up a PAD for it, but we want to know what you think about,doing it at that time.;CDR
58512.4;CDR;Well, we'll do it. Could you give us a little bit more time?;CAPCOM
58517.4;FLIGHT;No, I don't - wait a minute!;ALL

58528.4;FLIGHT;Get a suggested Tig time from him, Jack, that he's comfortable with. Yeah, it's,not going to cost us much water.;ALL
58534.4;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. We'd like to get a suggested time from you. We can figure out a free-return maneuver for any time you want to give us, so if you'll give us the time you'd like to shoot for, we'll figure out a PAD.;CDR
58551.4;CDR;Okay, that sounds good. I think if we have a little bit more time - we want to,do it right. Standby 1.;CAPCOM

58596.4;CAPCOM;Affirm.;CDR
58597.4;FLIGHT;Okay, FDO. You got that Tig?;FDO
58599.4;LMP;Okay. In the interim, Jack, I looked around again and I saw that we have a,radar and a landing radar heater breaker in. Can I pull those out?;CAPCOM

58614.4;FLIGHT;Okay. Proceed.;FDO
58616.4;CAPCOM;And now we want to ask you a question about alignments and so forth: we wanted,to know if you can see any stars out of the AOT. We also wanted to know if you,could use the Service Module to cast a shadow on the LM windows and then look,out the windows to see stars for a P51 COAS alignment.;CDR
58638.4;CDR;Okay, in this attitude, Jack, that we're pitching around, I cannot use the AOT,to see stars. We - we're just not able to see them at all. Now, we may be able,to maneuver off in yaw or - and/or roll, and see stars. Right now, we haven't,been able to. The AOT is useless. The Command Module structure is just,radiating too much light into the - into the telescope.;CAPCOM
58662.4;FLIGHT;Okay.;FDO
58665.4;CAPCOM;Okay. And how about using the Service Module to cast a shadow on the,Commander's window? If you do that, can you see stars for a COAS alignment?;CDR
58679.4;CDR; We could give that a try, Jack, although I don't know how successful it will be. We tried to do it ... The light shines off our quads which makes it difficult to see stars. We do have the Earth and the Moon, if that can be of assistance.;LMP
58696.4;FLIGHT;Okay. CAPCOM, I don't think he ought to do any special maneuvering to find this,out right now, do you? Don't talk them into that.;CAPCOM
58702.4;LMP; Another problem - Right now, Jack, I'm looking out the right window and it's pretty dark out that window but there are about a thousand or so false stars out here from - left over from some of the debris. It's hard to discern what's real and not real.;CDR
58722.4;CAPCOM;Okay. That's good information and during the time that we see you're continuing to pitch, if you ever get in a position where you think the AOT might be of some use, we'd like you to periodically look out of it and see if you can see some stars that would enable us to get a P52.;CDR
58724.4;FLIGHT;Okay. Let's concentrate on the burn.;CAPCOM
58743.4;CDR;Okay, will do. And also, let me ask you a question. In this configuration, docked, we have to use the TTCA to control pitch and roll. And, just how much can we use that without really changing our trajectory? We only have 60 miles to play with.;CAPCOM
58765.4;FLIGHT;I didn't hear all of his question. John?;CAPCOM

61543.4;FLIGHT;Yeah, I know. But have you got somebody talking to MIT?;GUIDO
61545.4;GUIDO;They're still talking to them, haven't got an estimate yet.;FLIGHT

61552.4;CONTROL;Go.;FLIGHT
61553.4;FLIGHT;How do I do this burn if I get a NO GO on - DAP control?;CONTROL
61557.4;CONTROL;Okay, standby 1, I'll give you a rundown on that, FLIGHT, put my thoughts,together.;FLIGHT
61561.4;FLIGHT;Yeah.;CONTROL
61562.4;GUIDO;FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.;FLIGHT
61563.4;FLIGHT;Go.;GUIDO
61564.4;GUIDO;I'd recommend going ahead and doing this burn if we don't hear from MIT. They,feel it'll work, without the run.;FLIGHT
61576.4;GUIDO;Everybody feels that it will work.;FLIGHT
61580.4;FLIGHT;Okay, well what do we do during it if it looks funny, is my question?;GUIDO
61588.4;GUIDO;During the burn?;FLIGHT
61589.4;FLIGHT;Yeah.;GUIDO
61606.4;FLIGHT;CONTROL, FLIGHT.;CONTROL
61607.4;CDR;Houston, we're going to do a PGNS AUTO maneuver to the attitude.;CAPCOM

61610.4;FLIGHT;PGN - okay, you want to do a PGNS AUTO or TTCA?;CONTROL
61613.4;CAPCOM; Stand by on that. Aquarius, we recommend driving it around there manually with a TTCA.;CDR
61614.4;CAPCOM;Standby on that.;CDR
61615.4;CONTROL;TTCA, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
61616.4;FLIGHT;TTCA, CAPCOM. We recommend TTCA to the attitude.;CAPCOM
61618.4;CAPCOM;Aquarius, we recommend driving it around there manually with a TTCA.;CDR
61621.4;FLIGHT;With a TTCA.;CAPCOM
61623.4;CDR;Okay, we have to use the TTCA. Roger.;CAPCOM
61629.4;FLIGHT;INCO, what's our OMNI for this burn attitude?;INCO
61633.4;INCO;FORWARD.;FLIGHT
61635.4;FLIGHT;Does he have it on there now?;INCO
61636.4;INCO;He's there now.;FLIGHT
61637.4;FLIGHT;Okay.;INCO
61639.4;CAPCOM;That attitude doesn't look like what I've got on the PAD, here.;FLIGHT
61648.4;CAPCOM;FLIGHT?;FLIGHT
61649.4;FLIGHT;Yeah.;CAPCOM
61650.4;CAPCOM;You like that attitude?;FLIGHT
61651.4;FLIGHT;I'm looking at it. Standby.;CAPCOM
61658.4;FLIGHT;GUIDANCE, FLIGHT. You copying that?;GUIDO
61661.4;GUIDO;What's on the ball right now?;FLIGHT
61664.4;FLIGHT;What angles are you looking at, CAPCOM? You looking at the ball angles?;CAPCOM
61668.4;CAPCOM;I'm looking at all of them. I'm looking at what he's got on the 50 18 on the,DSKY, and also what he's got on the FCDUs -;FLIGHT
61676.4;GUIDO;FLIGHT, the pitch and roll look great. The yaw - the only reason it looks,different is just because he's sitting there right now.;FLIGHT
61684.4;FLIGHT;Sitting where?;GUIDO
61686.4;GUIDO;With the attitude he's at presently. The pitch and yaw - and roll are correct.;FLIGHT
61692.4;FLIGHT;Yeah. On the DSKY. Is that right?;GUIDO
61696.4;GUIDO;Right.;FLIGHT
61697.4;FLIGHT;Yeah. The FDAI is different.;GUIDO
61699.4;GUIDO;FLIGHT, we're looking at the FCDUs and they're correct.;FLIGHT
61702.4;FLIGHT;Mmhmm. How about yaw? That's the one that's out yet? And is he moving in that,axis?;GUIDO
61706.4;GUIDO;Yaw doesn't matter, FLIGHT, that's about the thrust vector. That's just where,he happens to be.;FLIGHT
61710.4;CAPCOM;Okay, are we ready -;FLIGHT
61711.4;GUIDO;It's not constrained - it's not constrained in yaw.;FLIGHT
61712.4;CAPCOM;- for him to maneuver in the attitude we gave him in the -;FLIGHT
61713.4;FLIGHT;Yup.;GUIDO
61715.4;FLIGHT;Do you want him to go to a particular yaw?;GUIDO
61718.4;FLIGHT;GUIDANCE?;GUIDO
61719.4;GUIDO;Negative, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
61721.4;FLIGHT;We okay on the OMNI? That we're on?;INCO
61729.4;FLIGHT;INCO, we okay on this OMNI?;INCO
61731.4;INCO;Yes. The OMNI they're on will be good.;FLIGHT
61733.4;FLIGHT;Okay. GUIDANCE and CONTROL, FLIGHT.;GUIDO
61734.4;GUIDO;Go ahead.;FLIGHT
61735.4;CONTROL;Go, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
61736.4;FLIGHT;I still have a question as to what you want me to do if somehow or other,something turns up in the guidance during this burn.;GUIDO
61741.4;GUIDO;Okay, I have the recommendation, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
61743.4;FLIGHT;And it is?;GUIDO
61744.4;GUIDO;Okay, with tur - setting up the burn, we would turn the ENGINE GIMBAL switch to,OFF, we'd go to PGNS ATT HOLD, MIN IMPULSE on the - on the -;FLIGHT
61755.4;FLIGHT;Wait a minute. ENGINE GIMBAL - this - wait a minute. We're in the burn, and,this is what you -;GUIDO
61758.4;GUIDO;Oh. This is during the burn you're talking about?;FLIGHT
61760.4;FLIGHT;Well -;GUIDO
61761.4;GUIDO;Okay.;FLIGHT
61762.4;FLIGHT;That's when this started. What do you want me to do for -;GUIDO
61763.4;GUIDO;Okay. If he's in the burn, they'd go ENGINE GIMBAL off and just use the TTCA to,hold attitude. And then as he can, to turn the MODE CONTROL switch to ATT HOLD.;FLIGHT
61778.4;FLIGHT;MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD.;GUIDO
61780.4;GUIDO;Roger.;FLIGHT
61790.4;FLIGHT;In that order?;GUIDO
61792.4;GUIDO;Yeah. ENGINE GIMBAL off, MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD, and utilize the TTCA.;FLIGHT
61798.4;FLIGHT;Okay. So you changed the order.;GUIDO
61801.4;GUIDO;Well, this MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD, he can do that - he should do that as soon,as he can, but that - the most important thing is he get attitude control, and,he has to do that with the TTCA. So it'll probably be a simultaneous thing.;FLIGHT
61812.4;FLIGHT;Okay.;GUIDO
61813.4;CAPCOM;Okay, FLIGHT. Now, you verify his attitude?;FLIGHT
61815.4;FLIGHT;GUIDANCE? You verify his attitude is okay?;GUIDO
61820.4;GUIDO;He's not at attitude yet, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
61823.4;FLIGHT;Is he moving?;GUIDO
61824.4;GUIDO;Roger. He is moving. When he gets there, he'll be in good shape.;FLIGHT
61827.4;FLIGHT;Is there any way we can check this now, is there a star out of his window or,anything?;GUIDO
61831.4;GUIDO;We're running this - right now, we're running to see if there is a star,available at the attitude he's maneuvering to.;FLIGHT
61836.4;FLIGHT;Alright. Hurry up.;GUIDO
61837.4;GUIDO;There wasn't at the other atti - previous one that we had.;FLIGHT
61840.4;FLIGHT;Alright.;GUIDO
61841.4;GUIDO;But he's at a different - going to a different yaw, so we're checking it.;FLIGHT
61889.4;FAO;FLIGHT, FAO.;FLIGHT
61890.4;FLIGHT;Go.;FAO
61891.4;FAO;If we don't get to attitude soon, we're going to be running behind here.;FLIGHT
61897.4;FLIGHT;Okay. How far away are we?;FAO
61899.4;FAO;I'm in the same boat as -;FLIGHT
61902.4;FLIGHT;GUIDANCE, what are the DP - IMU attitudes that are on the DSKY that we're,looking for?;GUIDO
61907.4;FLIGHT;GUIDANCE?;GUIDO
61908.4;GUIDO;The IMU?;FLIGHT
61910.4;FLIGHT;What attitude will you read on the DSKY when he's in-attitude?;GUIDO
61915.4;GUIDO;15.7 -;FLIGHT
61916.4;FLIGHT;CDU.;GUIDO
61917.4;GUIDO;- is yaw. Pitch is 178.1, and roll is 4.47.;FLIGHT
61924.4;FLIGHT;How far away is he?;GUIDO
61925.4;GUIDO;He's just about there. He's right there now, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
61930.4;CAPCOM;We got any physical reference he can use?;FLIGHT
61932.4;FLIGHT;Okay. Have you seen any star yet?;CAPCOM
61935.4;CDR;We're going to AUTO now, Houston, to try to damp the rates. We're at the,attitude.;CAPCOM

61941.4;FLIGHT;GUIDANCE, you like the attitude?;GUIDO
61944.4;GUIDO;Looks good, FLIGHT. The attitude looks good.;FLIGHT
61946.4;CAPCOM; Roger, Jim. We verify the attitude.;CDR

61961.4;GUIDO;FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.;FLIGHT
61962.4;FLIGHT;Have you got anything on confirming the attitude?;GUIDO
61966.4;GUIDO;Negative, FLIGHT. The only star available is star 86, there.;FLIGHT
61972.4;GUIDO;FLIGHT, MIT will not have a run on this thing.;FLIGHT
61976.4;FLIGHT;Okay, now - but it is the judgement that it is okay to use?;GUIDO
61979.4;GUIDO;Roger.;FLIGHT
61980.4;FLIGHT;It is. Alright.;GUIDO
61981.4;GUIDO;It's the judgement of the software people it's GO - it's good.;FLIGHT
61985.4;GUIDO;That it'll be alright.;FLIGHT

62004.4;CONTROL;FLIGHT, CONTROL.;FLIGHT
62005.4;FLIGHT;Go.;CONTROL
62006.4;CONTROL;Okay. Could we possibly look ahead here and get some of these done so it,doesn't get too crowded right by the start of the burn? There's a couple of,items that need to be taken care of.;FLIGHT

62054.4;FLIGHT;CAPCOM, FLIGHT.;CAPCOM
62059.4;CAPCOM;Go.;FLIGHT
62060.4;FLIGHT;Jack, your opinion: think it would be worth reviewing that if he sees any kind,of rates or anything to go ENGINE GIMBAL OFF, MODE CONTROL ATT CONTROL -,ATTITUDE HOLD, and TTCA? You think it's worth reviewing with him?;CAPCOM
62073.4;FLIGHT;To finish the burn?;CAPCOM
62079.4;CAPCOM;I don't think it would hurt it to talk it over with him.;FLIGHT
62081.4;LMP;And Houston, we'd like to confirm: do you want the VERB 65 ENTER in there?;CAPCOM

62537.4;CONTROL;Roger.;FLIGHT
62545.4;FLIGHT;Okay, CONTROL. The next question is what control mode, if any, do you want to,be in, here? Work with the back room. Do we want to try to set up some kind of,PTC in AGS or are we just going to power down, let this thing drift?;CONTROL
62556.4;CONTROL;Okay. Let me pull my thoughts together for a minute, Glynn.;FLIGHT
62558.4;FLIGHT;Yeah. Okay, but you have somebody work that -;CONTROL

62601.4;CAPCOM; Aquarius, check your Master Arm, Off, please. [Long pause.];LMP
62603.4;CONTROL;The only thing I might recommend, if he wants to - is a VERB 76 but I'm happy,with the way it is right now.;FLIGHT

62623.4;FLIGHT;Well, that's what I'm asking you to check.;CONTROL
62624.4;CONTROL;Yeah, okay. But let's not turn the PGNS off right quick-like. Let me check for,you.;FLIGHT
62628.4;CDR; Okay, Houston. Burn's complete. Now we have to talk about power-down, and what do you want us to do with the PGNS?;CAPCOM
62636.4;FLIGHT;That's what we're going through right now.;CONTROL
62637.4;CAPCOM; Roger. We're looking at that right now, and you'll be the first one to get the word. [Long pause.];CDR
62648.4;INCO;FLIGHT, INCO.;FLIGHT
62649.4;FLIGHT;Go ahead.;INCO
62650.4;INCO;If you're going to do something with powering down, you'd better do it quick,,because I'm going to have to make you do a handover here, and it's probably,going to cost you COMM for at least 5 minutes.;FLIGHT

62661.4;INCO;Well, the handover's going to have to go on here in about - 12, 13 minutes.;FLIGHT
62663.4;CDR;And Houston, it's doubtful right now whether we'll be able to see the stars in,this configuration. The only way we could possibly get alignment is with the,Earth and the terminator or the Moon and its terminator and I'd sure like to,have you look at a powerdown - keeping the PGNS if at all possible.;CAPCOM
62665.4;FLIGHT;Okay.;INCO
62666.4;INCO;And we want to turn off the receiver - transceiver for 5 minutes up here.;FLIGHT

62715.4;FLIGHT;The current situation is - is that we're checking about the PTC. We had - do we,have an AGS procedure for setting up a PTC now? CONTROL? That people think,might work?;FDO
62727.4;FLIGHT;CONTROL, FLIGHT.;CONTROL
62728.4;CONTROL;Go ahead, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT

62732.4;CONTROL;Negative. Do not.;FLIGHT
62733.4;FLIGHT;We don't have a procedure?;CONTROL

62744.4;CONTROL;That's right.;FLIGHT
62748.4;CONTROL;Standby 1, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
62751.4;FLIGHT;Jim's checking to see what he wants to tell us about PTC -;CONTROL
62753.4;CONTROL;We're getting input from SPAN, it looks like no issue here - there's no PTC,required.;FLIGHT
62757.4;FLIGHT;Okay, well, we'll wait and see in a minute. If that's so, there's no need in,powering the AGS up.;CONTROL
62760.4;CONTROL;That's right.;FLIGHT
62762.4;FLIGHT;We're waiting for them.;CONTROL
62766.4;FLIGHT;Okay, and if that's the case, then we'll go ahead down. The only reason I'm,delaying powering the PGNS down is to be sure we don't need the AGS. It sounds,like we don't know how to use it anyway, but I - give them 2 minutes and we,ought to know for sure.;CONTROL
62778.4;CONTROL;FLIGHT, CONTROL.;FLIGHT
62779.4;FLIGHT;Go ahead.;CONTROL
62780.4;CONTROL;As I understand it, we're doing another burn at roughly 79 hours?;FLIGHT

63922.4;LMP;" Okay. Stand by on your latter list there, Jack. I understand no urine dumps. I guess we'll work through the UCD and all the bags we got; and real quick there, can you give a DAP load that we want in here now to conserve the RCS. [Long pause.]";CAPCOM
63927.4;FLIGHT;I guess they're just going to have to watch it.;CONTROL
63928.4;CONTROL;He's got nothing to watch on board. We're powering everything down.;FLIGHT
63931.4;FLIGHT;No, we're going to leave the IMU up.;CONTROL
63933.4;CONTROL;Okay. Got to leave the inverters up, then.;FLIGHT
63935.4;FLIGHT;Okay, well that's what I'm waiting for TELMU to tell me.;CONTROL
63938.4;CAPCOM;We need a DAP load to conserve RCS.;FLIGHT
63942.4;FLIGHT;A DAP load to conserve RCS, CONTROL.;CONTROL
63947.4;CONTROL;Okay. He wants it right now?;FLIGHT
63950.4;FLIGHT;Yeah.;CONTROL
63951.4;CAPCOM;Right now.;CONTROL
63966.4;CONTROL;FLIGHT, CONTROL.;FLIGHT
63967.4;FLIGHT;Go ahead.;CONTROL
63968.4;CONTROL;Recommend he goes VERB 76 MIN IMPULSE, and then keep his eye on the middle,gimbal angle.;FLIGHT
63973.4;FLIGHT;Okay. Is that all you've got to tell them for the DAP?;CONTROL
63974.4;CONTROL;Yeah, the DAP load's okay. But he needs to go MIN IMPULSE.;FLIGHT
63978.4;FLIGHT;Okay.;CONTROL
63979.4;CONTROL;VERB 76. And keep an eye on the middle gimbal angle.;FLIGHT
63983.4;FLIGHT;TELMU, FLIGHT.;TELMU
63986.4;CAPCOM;Okay. For attitude control coordinates, we're recommending manual control Verb 76 and watch your middle gimbal angle. Your DAP load that you have now looks good.;LMP
63987.4;TELMU;Go, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
63988.4;FLIGHT;I guess I kind of need to know, here, as much as you do -;TELMU
63989.4;TELMU;Roger.;FLIGHT
63990.4;FLIGHT;- if we're okay to leave the IMU up and we can swing it. Then I'd just as soon,do that.;TELMU
63995.4;TELMU;Yeah. I think that's the way it's looking right now.;FLIGHT
63997.4;FLIGHT;Okay, how long will it take you to conclude that?;TELMU
64001.4;LMP;Okay, it's ATT HOLD VERB 76 for the guy on watch. And the DAP load we've got,right now is okay.;CAPCOM
64003.4;TELMU;Just a couple more minutes.;FLIGHT
64022.4;CAPCOM;Do we have a PAD for 79 hours?;FLIGHT
64025.4;FLIGHT;Not yet, I'm sure.;CAPCOM
64044.4;FLIGHT;"Okay, gentlemen. The proposal before the room right now is to turn down the LGC,and to pick up all the rest of the smaller power items we can. Leave the IMU,up; TELMU's within a few minutes of -";TELMU
64055.4;TELMU;Yeah.;FLIGHT
64057.4;TELMU;We can - we can do that, FLIGHT, with the IMU up and the AC. It looks like it,would probably -;FLIGHT
64062.4;FLIGHT;The AC. You mean one ball. Okay. Is that what you mean?;TELMU
64065.4;TELMU;Yeah. Inverters. Yeah. Looks like also it would probably be cheaper,,power-wise, to turn the steerable on, if we could get COMMs attention here -,INCO.;FLIGHT
64074.4;FLIGHT;INCO, you up?;INCO
64075.4;INCO;Yes.;FLIGHT
64076.4;TELMU;Turn the steerable up, since we've got the AC anyway, and power down the POWER,AMPL.;FLIGHT
64082.4;FLIGHT;Is that cheaper?;TELMU
64083.4;TELMU;It's cheaper power-wise.;FLIGHT
64084.4;FLIGHT;INCO, is that okay with you?;INCO
64086.4;INCO;We'll give it a try.;FLIGHT
64088.4;FLIGHT;That gives us kind of - spotty coverage, doesn't it?;INCO
64091.4;INCO;We're going to have to get into a different attitude.;FLIGHT
64093.4;FLIGHT;We're going to have to roll.;INCO
64095.4;INCO;That's right. We're going to have to get out of the attitude we're in.;FLIGHT
64098.4;FLIGHT;Can you do it on the high-gain, or - you can't switch OMNIs anyway.;INCO
64102.4;FLIGHT;But we've got a guy awake.;INCO
64103.4;INCO;He'll have to do it for us.;FLIGHT
64104.4;FLIGHT;We've got a guy awake anyway.;INCO
64107.4;FLIGHT;Well -;INCO
64110.4;FLIGHT;Will we get high-gain coverage, and then we'll drop off, is that what'll happen?;INCO
64113.4;INCO;Yeah, it'll go at the end of blockage or gimbal limits and he'll have to switch,to an OMNI.;FLIGHT
64117.4;FLIGHT;Recommend something to me, will you? How many amps do we save?;INCO
64120.4;TELMU;FLIGHT, we'd just save about an amp and a half, so it's not a -;FLIGHT
64124.4;FLIGHT;And it's not a - it's not a coolant item. It's not a water item, is it?;TELMU
64125.4;TELMU;No.;FLIGHT
64126.4;FLIGHT;Alright, I'm - let's let that go for tonight anyway. Maybe we'll figure,something clever out tomorrow night.;TELMU
64130.4;TELMU;Okay, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
64133.4;FLIGHT;Okay, TELMU. Have you concluded on this LGC?;TELMU
64138.4;TELMU;We're going to leave the IMU up, right?;FLIGHT
64139.4;FLIGHT;Yeah, but the computer you want to go down? If we want that, let's get on with,it.;TELMU
64143.4;FLIGHT;CONTROL, FLIGHT.;CONTROL
64144.4;CONTROL;Go ahead, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
64145.4;FLIGHT;You ready? You and TELMU, are you together there -;CONTROL
64147.4;CONTROL;Yeah, I'm trying to get - get my ducks in a row with him right now, FLIGHT.,Standby.;FLIGHT
64152.4;GUIDO;FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.;FLIGHT
64153.4;FLIGHT;Go ahead.;GUIDO
64154.4;GUIDO;You asked a while ago about some stars. I've got some - I picked out some stars,to look - if you - I don't know if he wants to do any maneuvering - the,maneuver, it's 180 degrees from the Sun. To center the COAS.;FLIGHT
64161.4;CAPCOM; Aquarius, our decision for the time is to leave the IMU powered up, power down the LGC, and power down other nonessential items. We'll be coming up with a more precise checklist as soon as we can get it. Over.;LMP
64166.4;FLIGHT;Okay. Well, standby with it.;GUIDO
64180.4;LMP; Okay. The decision is to keep the platform, power down the computer, and we'll be standing by for further word on the powerdown, Jack.;CAPCOM
64192.4;CAPCOM;Roger.;LMP
64193.4;CONTROL;FLIGHT, from CONTROL.;FLIGHT
64194.4;FLIGHT;Go.;CONTROL
64195.4;CONTROL;Did we just tell him to power the computer down?;FLIGHT
64196.4;FLIGHT;No, we're just advising on what the plan's going to be.;CONTROL
64197.4;CONTROL;Oh, okay.;FLIGHT
64198.4;FLIGHT;But we're waiting.;CONTROL
64199.4;CONTROL;Yeah, okay.;FLIGHT
64237.4;CAPCOM;And Aquarius, for your information, we now have a 136 mile perigee.;LMP
64246.4;CAPCOM;Confirmed by doppler.;LMP
64251.4;LMP;Okay. 136-mile perigee now. That's very nice. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
64260.4;FLIGHT;TELMU and CONTROL, have you got there yet?;TELMU
64262.4;TELMU;Roger, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
64264.4;FLIGHT;You're GO to power the LGC down?;CONTROL
64265.4;CONTROL;Right.;FLIGHT
64266.4;TELMU;Yeah. LGC and IMU.;FLIGHT
64267.4;FLIGHT;What do you want to do? Pull the circuit breakers?;TELMU
64269.4;TELMU;Standby.;FLIGHT
64270.4;FLIGHT;Did you give me something on it? I think Bob Carlton did, didn't you, Bob?;CONTROL
64274.4;LMP;Oh. Wait a minute, Jack. Did you say pericynthion or perigee?;CAPCOM
64275.4;CONTROL;You said power down or power up?;FLIGHT
64276.4;FLIGHT;Down.;CONTROL
64277.4;CONTROL;Oh.;FLIGHT
64278.4;CAPCOM; I meant pericynthion.;LMP
64280.4;FLIGHT;CONTROL?;CONTROL
64281.4;CONTROL;Yeah.;FLIGHT
64282.4;FLIGHT;I'm talking - we're going to leave the IMU up, then. Are you ready to proceed,and power the computer down?;CONTROL
64283.4;LMP; Ah. That's better.;CDR
64284.4;LMP;That's better!;CAPCOM
64286.4;CONTROL;Negative! I do not want to power the computer down.;FLIGHT
64288.4;FLIGHT;Now why not?;CONTROL
64289.4;CONTROL;I'm being told that we can leave it up for the sleep period and it will keep,their attitude for them, keep them out of gimbal lock.;FLIGHT
64297.4;FLIGHT;The computer also?;CONTROL
64298.4;CONTROL;Yes. That's what I've been told. The LGC.;FLIGHT
64306.4;FLIGHT;Okay. So you'd tell them to leave the computer up also, huh?;CONTROL
64309.4;CONTROL;Affirmative.;FLIGHT
64310.4;FLIGHT;And that's okay on the profile?;TELMU
64311.4;TELMU;That's affirmative.;FLIGHT
64313.4;TELMU;It's about 22 amps total.;FLIGHT
64315.4;FLIGHT;And what kind of control mode do you see them being in, here tonight?;CONTROL
64318.4;CONTROL;Okay, just in a 5 degree deadband ATTITUDE HOLD.;FLIGHT
64322.4;FLIGHT;Wait a minute. We don't want to be in ATTITUDE HOLD. We want to roll - oh, you,want to let roll go?;CONTROL
64326.4;CONTROL;You can't let roll go. It's going to be an ATT HOLD.;FLIGHT
64331.4;FLIGHT;Okay, but - Hal, can we fly ATT HOLD the whole time? We're going to burn,something up!;CONTROL
64337.4;CONTROL;I've got the question in, I haven't got an answer on it yet, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
64342.4;CONTROL;The tentative answer I got was we did not require any PTC.;FLIGHT
64348.4;CONTROL;Yeah, the only problem, Glynn, if - in the other mode, if we just leave the,platform up, we may drift through gimbal lock and that would defeat the purpose,of leaving it up.;FLIGHT
64356.4;FLIGHT;We have a guy sitting there watching it! We're going to keep a guy up!;CONTROL
64361.4;CONTROL;Okay. And we'll have to leave the inverters on also, then.;FLIGHT
64363.4;FLIGHT;Yeah!;CONTROL
64364.4;CONTROL;Okay.;FLIGHT
64365.4;FLIGHT;That's - that was what I thought you were talking about!;CONTROL
64367.4;CONTROL;Negative. I was out of step with you, FLIGHT. Sorry.;FLIGHT
64369.4;FLIGHT;And we'll set up a roll manually, and we'll let them watch it and we'll do the,best we can like we did for Apollo 8.;CONTROL
64373.4;CONTROL;Okay. If he does it that way, he'll have to use hard-over command on the ACA to,stop any perturbations, then.;FLIGHT
64381.4;CONTROL;ATTITUDE DIRECT CONTROL breaker has to be in. Yes, use hard over on the ACA.;FLIGHT
64415.4;CONTROL;FLIGHT, CONTROL.;FLIGHT
64421.4;FLIGHT;Go ahead, CONTROL.;CONTROL
64423.4;CONTROL;Glynn, recommend we go ahead and power the LGC down, leaving the inverter on so,we can get an attitude reference off the platform, and leaving - let the guy,use the ACA to keep us out of gimbal lock.;FLIGHT
64436.4;FLIGHT;And set up whatever he can in the way of a -;CONTROL
64439.4;CONTROL;It'll be a PTC, it'll be a pilot yaw -;FLIGHT
64441.4;FLIGHT;Yeah.;CONTROL
64442.4;CONTROL;- okay? But he's gotta watch his roll.;FLIGHT
64445.4;FLIGHT;He's gotta watch the middle gimbal.;CONTROL
64446.4;CONTROL;Roger. The middle gimbal.;FLIGHT
64447.4;FLIGHT;Yeah. Okay. Now is that the conclusion and is that - presumably good on the,power profile and I want to see that profile by the way, TELMU? You copying,what we're doing?;TELMU
64458.4;TELMU;Go.;FLIGHT
64459.4;FLIGHT;We're going to put the LGC down and leave an eight-ball up and let them fly it,,set up whatever he can with body yaw.;TELMU
64466.4;TELMU;Roger.;FLIGHT
64467.4;FLIGHT;Is that - is that the conclusion?;TELMU
64469.4;FLIGHT;And you've got a power profile that says I'm okay to do that?;TELMU
64471.4;TELMU;Right.;FLIGHT
64472.4;FLIGHT;And you're going to show that to me.;TELMU
64474.4;TELMU;Right.;FLIGHT
64475.4;FLIGHT;Now, we're going to proceed then with the LGC power down. What do we do, pull,the circuit breaker?;CONTROL
64480.4;FLIGHT;Did you hand me that paper? I think we gave it to you, did we Jack?;CONTROL
64484.4;CONTROL;Is that the paper Carlton brought up?;FLIGHT
64485.4;FLIGHT;Yeah. Let - let me see.;CONTROL
64486.4;CONTROL;That wasn't - that's not what you want, now.;FLIGHT
64488.4;FLIGHT;No, it isn't. You're right.;CONTROL
64491.4;FLIGHT;You're right. What do I want to pull to power down the LGC?;CONTROL
64501.4;CONTROL;Okay, you need PROGRAM 6, and then pull the PNGS LGC/DSKY breaker on panel 11.;FLIGHT
64509.4;FLIGHT;You mean put it in PROGRAM 6 -;CONTROL
64511.4;CONTROL;Yeah.;FLIGHT
64512.4;FLIGHT;- and pull the LGC/DSKY -;CONTROL
64513.4;CONTROL;PROGRAM 6, hit a PRO.;FLIGHT
64516.4;FLIGHT;Okay.;CONTROL
64517.4;CONTROL;And then pull, on CB11, the PNGS: LGC/DSKY breaker.;FLIGHT
64521.4;FLIGHT;Okay.;CONTROL
64522.4;CAPCOM;Do you have a procedure written down in the purpose checklist? G&N dictionary,,and if we can refer to it, why I think that would be the way to do it.;FLIGHT
64533.4;FLIGHT;Do you got it there, Spence?;CAPCOM
64539.4;FLIGHT;Okay, does everybody copy what we're doing? TELMU, FLIGHT.;TELMU
64543.4;TELMU;Go, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
64544.4;FLIGHT;Would you check with SPAN one more time and be sure they're satisfied with what,we're doing, we'll do the best we can to set up a body yaw and let the awake,guy watch it. Okay? Could you check on them, be sure they understand what we're,doing?;TELMU
64556.4;TELMU;Roger.;FLIGHT
64571.4;FLIGHT;GUIDANCE and FAO, FLIGHT.;GUIDO
64572.4;GUIDO;Go, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
64573.4;FLIGHT;Would you let me - give me the ball angles for the pilots to go nose North? CSM,nose North?;GUIDO
64580.4;GUIDO;CMS nose North. Will do.;FLIGHT
64582.4;FLIGHT;That is PTC.;GUIDO
64583.4;CDR; And, Houston, we pulled out your Updata Link circuit breaker, so if you want to update it for anything, let us know and we'll put it back in.;CAPCOM
64592.4;CAPCOM;Roger, Jim. We will.;LMP
64611.4;CAPCOM;You ready for me to give them the LGC powerdown procedure -;FLIGHT
64613.4;FLIGHT;Let me get a GO here. CONTROL, you ready? TELMU, I mean - you ready? To get -,TELMU, FLIGHT.;TELMU
64621.4;FLIGHT;TELMU, FLIGHT.;TELMU
64622.4;TELMU;Go, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
64623.4;FLIGHT;Does SPAN know what you're doing and agree?;TELMU
64625.4;TELMU;I can't get in touch with them right now.;FLIGHT
64636.4;INCO;FLIGHT, INCO.;FLIGHT
64637.4;FLIGHT;Go ahead.;INCO
64638.4;INCO;We're ready to give a try at the POWER AMPL and the LOW BIT RATE and the DOWN,VOICE BACKUP if you want to try it.;FLIGHT
64643.4;FLIGHT;Wait a minute. Let me get my attitude and everything squared away.;INCO
64646.4;INCO;Okay.;FLIGHT
64648.4;FLIGHT;Having a hard time getting people to agree with the procedure. TELMU, CONTROL,,would you get - to see if the people agree with what we're doing?;CONTROL
64656.4;CONTROL;Say again, FLIGHT?;FLIGHT
64657.4;FLIGHT;I'm trying to get the SPAN people to agree with the course of action we have,here.;CONTROL
64660.4;CONTROL;I can't get a hold of them, FLIGHT.;FLIGHT
64661.4;FLIGHT;LGC OFF, and try to set up a body yaw, and let a man up to watch it.;CONTROL
64667.4;CONTROL;Roger.;FLIGHT
64668.4;FLIGHT;Can we hustle?;CONTROL
64669.4;CONTROL;Roger.;FLIGHT
64677.4;FLIGHT;And GUIDANCE, I'm standing by for some ball angles from you.;GUIDO
64680.8;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Aft Omni, please.;CDR
64686.8;CDR; Aft Omni.;LMP
64965.8;LMP;Houston, do you read Apollo 13?;CAPCOM
64969.8;CAPCOM; This is Houston. Go ahead. Reading you weakly.;CDR
64975.8;CDR; Okay, Jack. We don't want to bug you, but you ought to be thinking - or what your thoughts are concerning what the next burn will be. I got to figure out a watch schedule and the sleep schedule and just how we can meet the next maneuver.;CAPCOM
64994.8;CAPCOM; Roger. We're getting you a Flight Plan update. We're still computing on your next burn, and we're getting ready to give you a procedure for power-down.;CDR
65057.6;CAPCOM; Aquarius, one idea on managing the Omni antennas. It might make it easier on everybody if we disabled the Uplink Squelch and managed the antennas by switching when we hear the noise. Over.;CDR
65081.6;CDR; Roger. Will do.;CAPCOM
65630.6;CAPCOM; Okay, Aquarius. Here's what we're going to do. We'd like you to point the LM X-axis either north or south. That's the positive X-axis. It appears to us that it would be closer to orient the LM plus X-axis toward the south. Do that with the LGC powered up using the TTCA. After that, we propose to power down the LGC to save some power. However, this means that we lose the use of the TTCA, and we'll have to control the spacecraft with the hand controller in the Direct mode. Request your - your position on these two items. [Long pause.];CDR
65717.6;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. How do you read? [Pause.];CDR
65728.6;CDR; Okay, Jack. Understand. You want us to point the LM X - plus X-axis to the south using the TTCAs with the LGC powered up. Then, by powering down the LGC, we'll lose a TTCA. I wasn't too successful in controlling the spacecraft in attitude only, but I might be able to keep it out of gimbal lock.;CAPCOM
65757.6;CAPCOM; That's affirmative, Jim. We'd keep your ball powered up and go to Direct on the hand controller. And maintain attitude in a Direct position. [Pause.];CDR
65782.6;CDR;" Okay. Understand; and do you want some sort of a PTC mode, Jack?";CAPCOM
65790.6;CAPCOM; Affirmative. We'll take whatever PTC mode you can set up, Jim.;CDR
65797.6;CDR; Okay. And since you know our approximate attitude, how about just getting me something to find you on the DSKY for a southerly plus X-direction.;CAPCOM
65807.6;CAPCOM; Roger. Stand by one.;CDR
65898.6;CDR;And one other question, Houston. When you say power down the DSKY or the LGC, do you mean going into 06 or multiple circuit breaker?;CAPCOM
65911.6;CAPCOM; Stand by on powering down the DSKY, Jim. We'll give you the procedure for that. The procedure that we...;CDR
65920.6;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
65921.6;CAPCOM;...the procedure that we have is listed in several places. It's in the Contingency checklist under 'Power down' on page 1, second paragraph. [Pause.];CDR
65944.6;CAPCOM; And we'll give you that word when we want you to do that. That's LGC only, not to power down the IMU. But we'd like to have you hold off on that until we send you the word. Over.;CDR
65961.6;CDR; Understand.;CAPCOM
65974.2;CAPCOM; And, Aquarius, while we're working on this, we have a proposed Flight Plan update for your working and resting cycles. And - You ready to copy? [Pause.];CDR
65991.2;LMP; Okay. Do you want me to write this in the Flight Plan, per se, Jack?;CAPCOM
65996.2;CAPCOM; You can probably write it on a piece of scratch paper. This is pretty easy. [Pause.];LMP
66008.2;LMP; Okay. Go ahead. We got a lot of scratch paper.;CAPCOM
66016.2;CAPCOM;Okay. We're suggesting that the LMP rest while the CMP and CDR are awake. LMP ought to hit the sack at about 63 hours, coming up in 25 minutes. And you get to rest for 6 hours. You get up at 69 hours. At 70 hours, the commander and the Command Module Pilot sleep for 6 hours until 76 hours. Around 70 - 76Â½ to 77 hours, we'll do a P51 and a 52. At 78:30, we'll load P30 and align AGS to PGNS. Our ignition time for a second burn will be, presently, 79:25:26.5, and we'll have a PAD for you shortly. We suggest that all of you eat after the burn. That'll be 81 to 82 hours. Let the CMP and CDR eat while you are sleeping. And that you grab a bite as soon as you can. Over. [Long pause.];LMP
66162.2;LMP;Okay, Jack. As I read that, the LMP is to go to sleep at 63:00 for about 6 hours. During that period, the CDR and CMP should try to get a bite to eat. I'm to awake at 69 hours. CDR and CMP sleep at 70 hours, and they are to awake at 76 hours. And we should plan on doing our P51, P52 at 76 hours or 76:30. At 78:30, we're going to load a P30 and align AGS to PGNS. Second maneuver is to take place at 79:25:26.5 for ignition time. Then we're all to eat at 81 to 82 hours.;CAPCOM
66222.2;CAPCOM;Okay. With a minor modification, your P51, P52 will be about 77 hours, and that's the period of darkness. And the commander and the CMP ought to eat around 68 to 69 hours, and you should eat between 69 to 70 hours just after you get up. We have left an hour in there where everybody is awake together to talk things over. Go ahead.;LMP
66261.2;LMP;Okay. I'll eat after I wake up between 69 and 70.;CAPCOM
66270.2;CAPCOM; All right we have additional...;LMP
66272.2;LMP; ...and I've got the correction to P...;CAPCOM
66276.2;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Fred.;LMP
66277.2;LMP;Yes. We got the word the P51, P52 is going to be done around 77 hours, while we're in darkness.;CAPCOM
66288.2;CAPCOM; That's affirmative. And we have a work-rest cycle laid out for further on, which we can relay to you later.;LMP
66299.2;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CDR
66317.2;CDR; Okay. And, Houston, you have advice on what attitude you want me to go to.;CAPCOM
66327.2;CAPCOM; Okay. That'll be the next bit of information. I'll get that for you, Jim.;CDR
66333.2;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
66344.4;CAPCOM;And, Aquarius, just to get you thinking in that direction, we've run a fairly thorough analysis, and we've found out that it's going to be cheaper to keep the LGC and the DSKY up and turn the inverter and the ball off. It's going to save us 1 amp and also some water, so it looks like what we're going to do. And we'll have to monitor the middle gimbal angle. And we'll get the procedure on that, and it'll also be an easier control mode where we'll be able to use the TTCA through the - through the DAP.;CDR
66378.4;CDR; That sounds great, Jack.;CAPCOM
66394.2;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. We've got a procedure for you. Ready to copy? [Pause.];CDR
66406.2;CDR; Ready to copy.;CAPCOM
66408.2;CAPCOM;Okay. It's pretty easy. We see you've already got Verb 16 Noun 20 called up there and so we want you to, in maneuver and PGNS Attitude Hold, use the TTCA. We want you to, on the commander's ball, pitch to 267.5 and yaw to minus 4.5. And when you do this in Verb 16 Noun 20, on the DSKY, you ought to read plus 00120, plus 26750, and plus 00450. Go ahead. [Pause.];LMP
66460.2;LMP;Okay. We're to drive the commander's ball to a pitch of 267.5, yaw minus 4.5. And we should have in 16 20 at that time, plus 00120, plus 26750, plus 00450.;CAPCOM
66482.2;CAPCOM; That's a good readback. We'll watch the maneuver.;CDR
66931.2;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
66933.2;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CDR
66937.2;CDR; Roger. You didn't mention roll on the ball. Do you want roll zero? [Pause.];CAPCOM
66948.2;CAPCOM;The roll ought to be plus 1.2, Jim.;CDR
66955.2;CDR; Roger.;CAPCOM
67049.8;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
67052.8;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Jim.;CDR
67056.8;CDR; Okay. We're just about there in pitch and in [Garbled] middle gimbal angle, but that other gimbal angle didn't look like it pulled the right way. I tried both methods.;CAPCOM
67070.8;CAPCOM; Yes. I been looking at that, too, and we're asking why, and we'll get an answer for you. [Pause.];CDR
67088.8;LMP; Yes. Houston, I wonder if you're accounting for being a bit off the bellyband here, and I've gone through GASTA. [Pause.];CAPCOM
67106.8;CAPCOM;And, Freddo, I know you're supposed to start sleeping here pretty soon, but we got a new PC plus 2 PAD, P30 maneuver PAD for you. [Pause.];LMP
67124.8;CDR; Stand by. [Long pause.];LMP
67160.8;LMP; Okay. Go ahead, Jack.;CDR
67163.8;CAPCOM;"Okay, Fred. P30 maneuver purpose is PC plus 2, DPS to this time, we're going to the MPL.

Your GDA ought to be okay as it is from the last burn, but pitch ought to be at 5.85; in roll, it's 6.74. Your ullage will be two jets for 10 seconds. Your DPS throttle will be 10 percent for 5 seconds, 40 percent for 21 seconds, and the remainder at full throttle. And for your information, this will put you in the water at 142 plus 47. Over.

67390.8;LMP;Okay. Delta-V<sub>Z</sub> in Noun 81 is minus 02226.;CAPCOM
67396.8;CAPCOM; Okay. Good readback. [Pause.];LMP
67409.8;LMP; Somehow that didn't add up with the Delta-V<sub>X</sub> to give a Delta-V<sub>R</sub> of that magnitude. It seems like it'd been bigger.;CAPCOM
67420.8;CAPCOM; Okay. We'll take another look at it, Fred.;CDR
67577.8;CDR; Okay, Houston. I'm not having too much luck holding this particular attitude. [Pause.];CAPCOM
67590.8;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. Stand by one.;CDR
67685.8;CAPCOM;" Okay, Aquarius. When you get her pretty much in attitude there, and it looks like you're as close as we need to be, we'd like to try a control mode and see if it will work; sort of a semi-PTC. We'll leave the ball powered up for this, and if this doesn't work, why, we'll have to revert to Attitude Hold mode. But - Stand by one, please. [Long pause.]";CDR
67731.8;CAPCOM;We'd like you to think about this control mode, Jim, and see if you think it might work from what you know right now. We're a little skeptical, but we'd like to put it to you. So, once you get in a pretty good attitude, monitor in Verb 16 Noun 20, go to PGNS Minimum Impulse, Verb 76, as we have, and set up a yaw rate - yaw rate to the right. Monitor the middle gimbal on R3 on the DSKY and see if she'll kind of stabilize out. If not, the only other suggestion we've got is to go to PGNS Attitude Hold. We'll keep the ball up until you make this evaluation.;CDR
67773.8;CDR; Okay, Houston. You cut out, say again.;CAPCOM
67779.8;CAPCOM; Okay. Where'd you lose me, Jim?;CDR
67784.8;CDR;" I lost you when you said try the control mode; you're a little skeptical.";CAPCOM
67789.8;CAPCOM;Okay. From what you say, we have to be a little skeptical of this procedure, but we'd like to have you try it and have you evaluate it. You can monitor the middle gimbal on R3. Before we power down the ball, we want your evaluation. The next best choice is PGNS Attitude Hold. Over.;CDR
67812.8;CDR; Okay. I'll try it. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
67841.8;CDR; Okay. Go ahead with the control mode procedure. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
67878.8;CDR;" Hello, Houston; Aquarius.";CAPCOM
67881.8;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CDR
67884.8;CDR;Okay. I'm not [Garbled] you. I can monitor register 3. I can probably keep it out of [garbled] - going into gimbal lock.;CAPCOM
67897.8;CAPCOM; Roger. How are pitch and roll? [Long pause.];CDR
67948.8;CDR;Okay. I think I can control the gimbal angles in 16 20 with the compressors the way they are, but I'll have to try Minimum Impulse - Just a minute. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
67972.8;CMP; Okay, Jack. I've a question - one more question about Odyssey.;CAPCOM
67976.8;CAPCOM; Go ahead.;CMP
67982.8;CMP; Okay, I still have the Pyro A sequence A and Pyro B sequence B circuit breakers in. Do you want those out?;CAPCOM
67991.8;CAPCOM; Stand by one. [Long pause.];CMP
68005.8;CAPCOM; Odyssey, Houston. The two circuit breakers you referred to, leave them in.;CMP
68013.8;CMP; Okay. Copy. Leave them in. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
68027.8;CDR; Okay, Houston. I can control yaw in minimum impulse, but stand by on pitch. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
68045.8;CAPCOM; And, Freddo, the Delta-V<sub>R</sub> resultant computes with the components.;CDR
68057.8;CDR; Fred's off the comm now, Jack.;CAPCOM
68060.8;CAPCOM; Roger. Your PAD is good.;CDR
68063.8;LMP; And, Jack, we didn't get that whole sentence there.;CAPCOM
68067.8;CAPCOM; Okay. I said that the Delta-V<sub>R</sub> that Fred questioned computes well with the component - its RMS.;LMP
68077.8;LMP; Okay. Copy.;CDR
68082.8;CDR; Okay, now. Jack, let's go over this once more. You wanted me to try out control of the spacecraft in the Pulse mode. Is that correct?;LMP
68091.8;CAPCOM; That's affirmative. Set up a yaw right rate and monitor the middle gimbal angle.;CDR
68104.8;CDR; Okay. I can do that. I'm not too sure whether I can control roll or pitch in pulse, but I can control yaw in pulse - yaw in pulse on the ball.;CAPCOM
68118.8;CAPCOM;" Roger. And remember we're not going to have a ball there, so that we're going to be monitoring CDUs on the DSKY, and if we get it off, it will be pretty hard to figure out where to fly back to; and, well, in addition, have to control the Omnis while we're doing this.";CDR
68140.8;CDR; Roger. [Pause.];CAPCOM
68154.8;CDR; Without the ball, I still have use of the TTCA for control of the - angles.;CAPCOM
68160.8;CAPCOM; Affirmative. You'll have the TTCA for pitch and roll.;CDR
68166.8;CDR;Okay. I think I can do that without the ball, and if you just give me the TTCAs I think I can control the spacecraft using 16 20.;CAPCOM
68179.8;CDR; I'm going to yaw right. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
68197.8;CDR;Okay, Jack. I am now - The Register 1 is in the Decrease mode. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
68244.8;CDR; And, Houston, do you see anything wrong with this spacecraft motion?;CAPCOM
68254.8;CAPCOM;" We have a data drop on right now, Jim; we'll look at it as soon as it comes up.";CDR
68320.8;CAPCOM;Okay, Aquarius. We're going to dispense with this control mode. We'd like you to fly the machine back to the original attitude that you had, and we'll go PGNS Attitude Hold, and then we've got to get that ball off the line to save some power. And then, in order to keep even heating, every 15 or 30 minutes, we'll give you a call to give us 90 or 180 degrees of roll - of yaw.;CDR
68355.8;CDR; Okay. You want me to go back to original attitude. I'll be going back to it now.;CAPCOM
68391.0;CDR;"Okay, Houston; Aquarius. I'm flying it back over towards the initial angles you gave me of a pitch of 257. I'll get near the bellyband in roll and yaw; then I'll go to PGNS Att Hold.";CAPCOM
68402.0;CAPCOM; That's affirmative, Jim. And then we're going to have you go through a powerdown procedure.;CDR
68411.0;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
68417.0;CAPCOM;And you'll need Verb 77 with Att Hold when you get there.;CDR
68423.0;CDR; Will do.;CAPCOM
68583.0;CDR;Okay, Jack. Have I gotten your 360 on yaw and roll? I'm going to go to Att Hold.;CAPCOM
68591.0;CAPCOM; Roger. And then we want to get the ball powered down.;CDR
68597.0;CDR; Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
68647.0;CDR; Okay. I'm now in PGNS Att Hold. And are you reading my DSKY angles?;CAPCOM
68653.0;CAPCOM; Roger. We see them.;CDR
68658.0;CDR; Now, you want me to power down the ball, and if you'll give me the procedure for that, I'll do it right away.;CAPCOM
68661.0;CAPCOM;Okay. We'll buy what you've got on the DSKY there, and we'd just like to go through an overall powerdown procedure, and in so doing we'll catch the ball and inverter and it will only take a few minutes. So are you ready to start on panel 11?;CDR
68678.0;CDR; Roger. Jack will copy, and I'll do the work.;CAPCOM

68722.0;CDR; Okay. First six on the left are closed - That's through the ISOL Valve, but I opened up every one from there on.;CAPCOM
68728.0;CAPCOM;Okay. Third row, open up the next five - correction - Open up the first five on the left, close AOT Heater, close Sig[nal] Conditioner 1. Close Attitude Direct, and open the rest on row three.;CDR
68761.0;CDR; Do you want ATCA (PGNS) open?;CAPCOM
68768.0;CAPCOM;"Leave ATCA (PGNS) closed; four breakers on the third row must be closed. AOT Heater, Sig Conditioner 1, and ATCA (PGNS), Attitude Direct Control. Our mistake, good going.";CDR

68858.0;CDR; That's complete, Jack.;CAPCOM
68862.0;CAPCOM;"Okay. And EPS, close BAT Feed Ties, Cross Tie Bal Load, and open the Cross Tie Bus. Close the next three; open Ascent ECA Control, Ascent ECA, and Inverter 1. Close DC Bus Volt. Go ahead.";CDR
68897.0;CDR;That's complete, Jack. Panel 11 is configured.;CAPCOM

68922.0;CDR; Stand by, Jack. [Pause.];CAPCOM
68933.0;CDR; Okay. Starting from the left, open the first four.;CAPCOM
68938.0;CAPCOM; Okay. And close the Isol Valve, keep your TCA breakers closed, close the Crossfeed, open the next two displays. Close the Main SOV and the Propulsion breakers should all three be open.;CDR
68963.0;CDR; Roger. The main valves are closed, and the Display Engine Override Logic's coming open, and the PQGS and ASC He REG are open.;CAPCOM
68973.0;CAPCOM;That's affirmative. The second row: they should all be open except for three breakers under instrumentation. Close Sig Sensor, PCM/TE, and Sig Conditioner 2. Over.;CDR
68996.0;CDR; Roger. Do you want Suit Flow Control open? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
69012.0;CDR; Engine ARM coming open and ASA I guess will be open. Is that correct?;CAPCOM
69016.0;CAPCOM; We just got a change on that. Let's keep the ASA closed.;CDR
69024.0;CDR; How about Suit Flow Control and Engine ARM? [Pause.];CAPCOM
69037.0;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. Suit Flow Control can be open, and Engine Arm - Engine Arm open.;CDR
69055.0;CDR;Okay. Let's go to row 3.;CAPCOM
69059.0;CAPCOM;Okay. Row 3 under Comm. Open Displays, close SE Audio, open VHF A Transmitter and B Receiver, close the Primary S-Band circuit breakers, both of them. Open the S-Band Antenna, PMP closed, TV open, and all the rest of them open under ECS, except CO<sub>2</sub> Sensor, closed.;CDR

69190.0;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. And we've already got a change to what we just told you. Under ECS, close the Cabin Repress, and ensure that the ASA Breaker is closed under S and C.;CDR
69211.0;CDR; The ASA Breaker is closed, but I closed the Cabin Repress.;CAPCOM
69220.0;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim. Looks like what we have to do is - In order to maintain even heating, we just have to yaw the whole machine about 90 degrees per hour in increments. So we'll give you a call when it's time to yaw 90 degrees. [Long pause.];CDR
69259.0;CDR;Okay. We have to yaw the machine as I understand it, Houston, and you'll give it to me in increments of 90 degrees.;CAPCOM
69266.0;CAPCOM; That's affirm.;CDR
69331.0;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim. Your present configuration has the following features. We got the electrical Buses cross tied through the Bal Load circuit breakers, and we have Auto Cabin Repress. One thing we'd like to do right now is to give you an uplink, so immediately we have to, on panel 11, close the Updata Link circuit breaker. Go to P00 and Data. Over. [Pause.];CDR
69367.0;CDR;Okay. We're going to P00 and Data. The circuit breaker is closed.;CAPCOM
69398.2;CDR; Houston, Aquarius. Did you say that you had a new PAD for us to copy?;CAPCOM
69403.2;CAPCOM;Jim, I passed that newest PAD that we have to Fred about 30 minutes ago. That's our latest. It's PC plus 2, and it begins with Noun 33 of 79 hours 27 minutes and 40.13 seconds. You got that one?;CDR
69426.2;CDR; Okay. We've got that one. What kind of a Att Hold Mode do you want us to do? Do you want us to do Wide Dead band? I didn't [garbled] on the DAP.;CAPCOM
69441.2;CAPCOM;Jim, the dead band is good the way it is. It's 5 degrees, if you want to stay in it. And stay in the PGNS Att Hold mode.;CDR
69450.2;CDR; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
69494.2;CAPCOM; Two things, Jim. We want you to know that there's some pretty big attitude errors in, so if you go to Auto, the computer is going to try to crank you around, and the other thing is don't drink water out of the LM. [Pause.];CDR
69515.2;CDR; Okay. You might think about this. You know we lost our oxygen pressure in the Command Module. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
69577.2;CAPCOM; Aquarius, we're finished with the uplink. The computer is yours, and you can open the Updata Link circuit breaker. [Long pause.];CDR
69599.2;CDR;Okay. We've opened up the Updata Link, and we've gone Off of Data, and I've got 16 20 in the computer.;CAPCOM
69609.2;CAPCOM; Roger, Jim. I guess we're going to just kind of perk away here now.;CDR
69618.2;CMP; Okay, Jack. One more question about Odyssey here.;CAPCOM
69626.2;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Jack.;CMP
69631.2;CMP;Okay. How about the Service Module O<sub>2</sub> supply valve? Do you want that off?;CAPCOM
69642.2;CAPCOM;Affirmative. Service Module O<sub>2</sub> supply off, Jack.;CMP
69647.2;CMP; Okay. On the way. [Pause.];CAPCOM
69658.2;CAPCOM; And, Jim, we see a Program Alarm in there. We think it's just got to do with pulling the Updata Link circuit breaker - Updata too fast.;CMP
69671.2;CDR; Roger. I don't see it. Should I reset? [Pause.];CAPCOM
69681.2;CAPCOM; Go ahead and reset, Jim.;CDR
69691.2;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
69696.2;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CDR
69701.2;CDR; One thought that might occur here is that if we have low descent water pressure, we might consider taking the PLSS water and fill it in reverse. If that works, you might look at a procedure for that.;CAPCOM
69714.2;CAPCOM; That's a good thought. Let us bounce that around a little. [Long pause.];CDR
69752.2;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. That's a good thought, and we've looked at that, and it looks like that's feasible. So if and when we need to do that, we will. [Long pause.];CDR
69811.2;CDR;And, something else, Jack. When it's time for me to make my 90-degree yaw, what I planned on doing was going to Noun 76 hold and just pulse and yaw several times until the yaw start and hope that pitch and roll stay within the limit.;CAPCOM
69837.2;CAPCOM; Roger. It sounds like a good plan and you can use your TTCA in MIN IMPULSE to take care of pitch and roll.;CDR
69847.2;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
69941.2;CAPCOM;Aquarius, Houston. We see Ascent O<sub>2</sub> tank number 2 building up again, so we'd like to use something out of it, so turn on ascent O<sub>2</sub> tank number 2 and turn off descent O<sub>2</sub>.;CDR
69959.2;CDR;Roger. Opening up ascent O<sub>2</sub> tank number 2, and turning off descent.;CAPCOM
70101.2;CAPCOM;And, Aquarius, Houston. We're starting to think about CO<sub>2</sub> buildup up in the Command Module there so we've got a recommendation, and what we're recommending is that you take the commander's hoses in the LM and put a cap over the red return hose and then figure out a way to fasten those hoses so they blow up into the CSM by extending them up through the tunnel as far as possible. And we'll get some flow out the blue side, circulate up and around the Command Module and to keep the CO<sub>2</sub> level down.;CDR
70143.2;CDR; Roger. We're thinking of that too, and one problem is that the comm is connected securely to the hose, so we've got to get the comm cable off somehow to get that - So we'll still have comm down here in the LM and you have the hose up there.;CAPCOM
70230.2;CDR; Houston, we're trying to extend that commander's hose by use of the vacuum hose.;CAPCOM
70242.2;CAPCOM; Sounds like a good plan if you can work that out, Jim.;CDR
70338.2;CAPCOM; Aquarius, if you can shake Jack loose there, I've got a - some procedures for him to write down.;CDR
70349.2;CDR; Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
70373.2;CMP; Okay, Jack. Is this a long one?;CAPCOM
70377.2;CAPCOM;Oh, it's about 12 - 15 lines. It's a matter of verifying some valves and so forth. [Pause.];CMP
70390.2;CMP; Okay. Go ahead.;CAPCOM
70393.2;CAPCOM;"Okay. We want you to go in when you can and verify the following valves and leave them as we outline here. Repress Package valve, Off; Emergency Cabin Pressure, Off; Direct O<sub>2</sub>, Off; Demand Reg, Off; both Water Accumulators, Off; Main REG A and B, Open; Water Glycol - correction - Water and then Glycol Tank Inlet and Outlet, both. Now if you want to get some water, we recommend that you momentarily turn the Surge Tank on to pressurize the system and then turn it off and take out water as required. Over. [Long pause.]";CMP
70493.2;CAPCOM;" That's it, Jack. And another note on taking water; if you don't drain enough water so that...";CT
70503.2;CT; [Garbled];CAPCOM
70509.2;CAPCOM; Say again, Aquarius.;CMP
70513.2;CMP; That wasn't us, Jack.;CAPCOM
70518.2;CAPCOM;Okay. One more note on the water, Jack. If you don't bleed the pressure off when you - don't take enough water to bleed the pressure off completely, the pressure that's left on there is going to drain away in a period of 1 to 3 hours. So it's a small amount of oxygen, but we might as well save it. So if you want to eliminate that problem you could completely drain the pressure off by putting the water in a water bag and saving it that way. [Pause.];CMP
70556.2;CMP; Okay. That's a good idea.;CAPCOM
70558.2;CAPCOM; So that's the end of my...;CMP
70559.2;CMP;"What I'll do - let me repeat - Okay. Let me repeat it all back to you. Repress Package valve, Off; Emergency Cabin Pressure, Off; Direct O<sub>2</sub>, Off; both the Demand Regs, Off; both H<sub>2</sub>O Accumulators, Water Glycol Accumulators, Off; Main Reg A and B, Open; Water and Glycol Tank Inlet and Outlet, Open; for water, momentarily pressurize the Surge Tank, take out water as required. You're recommending drain out all the water until I can't get any more water out of it in order to conserve the oxygen.";CAPCOM
70614.2;CAPCOM; Okay. We just want you to turn off the water accumulators and not the glycol accumulator. Over.;CMP
70629.2;CMP;Okay. These are the water accumulators on 382, right?;CAPCOM
70637.2;CAPCOM;That's affirm. The accumulators on 382.;CDR

If we can't hear you in a couple of minutes, you should close the Power Amp circuit breaker on panel 16, and we expect to save an amp or more on this. It should work in the present attitude. When we go to the new yaw attitude, we're thinking about powering up the steerable, leaving the Power Amp off and, if we can get good comm in that mode, we'll still save some power. So if you concur, why don't you go ahead. [Pause.];CDR

78567.6;CAPCOM;Okay, Fred. I have a few words for you on some things we want to do in the next few hours, and in order to get good comm for that and also in order to give FIDO a few minutes of ranging, I want to have you put the Power Amplifier circuit breaker in panel 16 in, the Voice Function switch to Voice, and Ranging Function switch to Ranging.

78621.6;LMP; Now I'm in Normal voice and Ranging is up.;CAPCOM
78626.6;CAPCOM;"Okay, Fred. And you're loud and clear down here now. Okay. What we're getting a procedure ready for you is to do an AOT Sun check at approximately 74 hours or in just a little over 3 hours. That will be a detent 2; we'll have a detail procedure up shortly and it will include a Rendezvous Radar redesignation to get it out of the way and a P52 maneuver to the attitude. It's our feeling that if that checks out within 1 degree that your platform will be okay for the burn without a subsequent P52. If it's not within 1 degree, we are working up an Earth/Sun alignment procedure to align the platform, and we'll have that up to you later. Okay. Assuming that the Sun check is okay, we will then give you a star for a confidence check on the back side when you're in the darkness. We'll be updating a burn PAD to you prior to LOS going around the Moon. We'll have another look at you after AOS, and we'll update the PAD if required. Right now that update should be very small. Over.";LMP
78712.6;LMP; Okay. Stand by one.;CAPCOM
78776.6;LMP;Okay. Joe. As I read that, at 74 hours we're going to do an AOT Sun check at detent 2, which is going to require the Rendezvous Radar out of the way. And we use P52 Auto maneuver to get there, or at least the angles out of that, and if this passes within 1 degree, you're saying the platform is okay for the maneuver, and we won't need a subsequent P52. But even if it is okay, you'll give us a star which we can use for our check when we're in darkness. If this check flunks, you'll pass us on up then an Earth/Moon align procedure.;CAPCOM
78829.6;CAPCOM;Okay, Fred. That's correct, except the align procedure that we're working on is an Earth/Sun align, and other than that, that's correct. Incidentally, this PC plus 2 maneuver looks like it will still be around a 900-foot-per-second maneuver and that it will get you back to the mid-Pacific line at 142 hours. [Pause.];LMP
78859.6;LMP;Okay. That was an Earth/Sun check, Joe. We're getting a little close to the Moon now. And the PC plus 2 maneuver still looks about 900 foot per second to get us at mid-PAC, at about 142 hours.;CAPCOM
78876.6;CAPCOM; That's right.;LMP
78926.6;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;LMP
78933.6;LMP; Go ahead, Joe.;CAPCOM
78935.6;CAPCOM;" Okay, Fred. We got a good batch of ranging and now we'd like you to reverse the configuration, Ranging to Off, Voice Function to Down Voice Backup, Power Amplifier circuit breaker out; we'll be talking to you.";LMP

79167.6;LMP; One other thing you might have somebody look at - I don't want to bother the guys upstairs - the drain hose that we've got in the Command Module, I wonder if we can find out if it will plug into the PLSS and in which case we can keep transferring - later on at least - the Command Module water into the LM via the PLSS.;CAPCOM
79197.6;CAPCOM;" Okay, Fred. You're almost up with us. We are looking real hard at getting water from the Command Module waste tank into the PLSS, using that hose and then dumping it from the PLSS into the LM ascent tank, and we think it is feasible; we're checking it out to make sure.";LMP

79577.9;CAPCOM;"Okay, Freddo. At the bottom of the page, we want step 1, on the flashing 0406, we want an option 3, and that'll pull us over to 6; and, on the 5025, we want you to do the Enter on the 5025, and that'll bring up flashing 0170, and load in R1, 200. Over. [Pause.]";LMP
79612.9;LMP;Okay. Let me see if I'm with you. We call up P52 and, on the flashing 0406, we Pro on a 3 REFSMMAT which leads us to a flashing 5025. We Enter on that. On the flashing 0170, we want to Enter a 200.;CAPCOM
79633.9;LMP;"That's affirmative; and after that, you Pro on that, and you come up with a flashing 0688, and we'll have to load Noun 88. And if you're ready to copy, I have the Sun half-unit vectors at 74 hours GET. Over. [Pause.]";CAPCOM
79656.9;LMP; Okay. Go ahead.;CAPCOM
79657.9;LMP;Okay. At Sun half-unit vectors, X, R1, is plus 0.45498, Y plus 19024, Z plus 08250. Over. [Pause.];CAPCOM
79689.9;LMP;Okay. We Pro on - after entering the 200. We'll get a flashing 0688. We then load the Sun unit vectors for 74 hours, which are R1 plus 5 - correction, plus 45498, R2 plus 19024, R3 plus 08250.;CAPCOM
79717.9;CAPCOM;"Roger. That's good, Freddo. And that'll bring you to step 8, and you get a flashing 5018 when you Pro on the Noun 88. Okay. At 5018, we want to do an Auto maneuver to - to the attitude, so just do the - the Pro with the Guidance Control, PNGS; Mode Control, PNGS, Auto; and we'll take this attitude. Now, that's going to put us at - at attitude for the Sun check. Now, we're being a 1.4-degree dead band in this program in a docked configuration; so, to help you out, you could call Verb 62 to get your needles - and it - when the needles go through zero or null out and - in that dead band - then you take a look in the AOT and see how close the Sun is. And we want within plus or minus 1 degree. Over.";LMP
79781.9;LMP;"Okay. So we Pro on the Noun 88, and we end up with a flashing 5018; and you want an Auto maneuver here rather than using the TTCA, so we Pro with Guidance, PNGS; Mode Control, Auto. We've got a 1.4-degree dead band with a Verb 62 will give us the needles to try to zero them in and, at that time I look through the AOT and, if it's like Apollo 11 Sun check, all we've got to have is the Sun somewhere in the - out there somewhere on the Sun as it passes. Is that correct?";CAPCOM
79819.9;LMP;"I think that's a little tight; that's about a quarter degree. We can go a little bit out of that. Stand by 1. Fred, we'll get you an answer on that one. And also, if you'll stand by, we'll give you a DAP load for this maneuver. Over.";CAPCOM

79843.9;CAPCOM; Roger. Stand by.;LMP
79948.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Freddo, on that - to pass that check, the Sun is at - will subtend an arc of one-half degree in the AOT, so you can be two diameters off and still pass the check. Over.;LMP
79968.9;LMP; Okay. It's a half a degree, and so we can be two Sun diameters off and still pass.;CAPCOM
79976.9;CAPCOM;That's affirmative. And we want you to maneuver with a DAP of 0.2 of a degree a second. Over. [Pause.];LMP
79988.9;LMP;Okay. You want us to use a DAP of 0.2.;CAPCOM
79993.9;CAPCOM;Okay. That DAP load, Freddo, is 31120. Over. [Pause.];LMP
80007.9;LMP;Okay. 31120.;CAPCOM
80010.9;CAPCOM;Roger. Now, if we pass that check, you can just terminate P52 right there, and we'll give you an attitude to go to a burn attitude, and from this we can get a star check. If you don't pass, we'd like you to do an alignment at 75 hours. And, if you're ready to copy, we have some Sun half-unit vectors and some Earth half-unit vectors at 75 hours. Over. [Long pause.];LMP

84280.7;CAPCOM; Fred, we're recommending Auto maneuver. Over.;LMP

91735.5;LMP; [Garble] How's the Earth?;CDR
91863.5;CDR; Houston, for what it's worth, we can probably give you a cursor spiral angle on Nunki and possibly Antares or more than likely Shaula.;CAPCOM
91880.5;CAPCOM; Roger, Jim. According to our calculations, Nunki should be, at burn time, pretty close to the center of the AOT. We've been talking that possibility. Over. [Pause.];CDR

92038.5;LMP; Okay. [Pause.];CDR
92048.5;LMP; Okay. I'll start on that.;CDR
92051.5;CDR; Okay, Vance.;LMP
92053.5;LMP; Go ahead.;CDR
92054.5;CDR; We're all set to go.;LMP
92057.5;CAPCOM;"Okay. Okay. First of all, general philosophy is that these rules should be similar to LOI mode I abort with the tight limits. Now, I'll go through them one by one for you to copy. Okay. You should shut down, if any of the following happen. Thrust monitor readout, 77 percent or below; DPS propellant tank pressure - that's the inlet pressure - onboard readout, 160 or below; fuel to OX Delta-P, greater than 25 psi - and that would have to be a ground call to you. Attitude error plus or minus 10 degrees, with the exception of the start transient; attitude-rate limits, plus or minus 10 degrees a second. And you should shut down if you get any of the following alarms: Engine Gimbal, ISS, plus Program Alarm, LGC, CES DC, and if you get an inverter light after switching inverters. Are you with me?";LMP
92198.5;LMP; Roger.;CAPCOM
92200.5;CAPCOM; Okay...;CDR
92201.5;CDR; Affirmative.;CAPCOM
92203.5;CAPCOM;"And proceeding on. If, during the burn, the engine stops, if you have a flashing Noun 97, you should Proceed, then ullage, Engine Start to Push, and Descent Engine Override On. Okay. Now just general information. If you didn't burn PC plus 2, probably P - C plus 4 would be the earliest MCC. AGS is going to backup in a rate-fail mode only, which you know. We're talking over the star check. Will have to get back with you on that. If, for some reason, there is no PC-2, you have a free-return trajectory with the landing at 152:02:00, and that would be after a small midcourse-5, which would probably be around 4 feet per second at 93 hours. And you have recovery forces in the Indian Ocean; you're in good shape there. And the Indian Ocean is where this landing would be. Okay. You still with me?";LMP
92339.5;LMP; Roger.;CAPCOM
92341.5;CAPCOM; Okay. After...;LMP
92343.5;LMP; Yes. I'm with you.;CAPCOM
92345.5;CAPCOM;"Okay. After PC plus 2, there are no trim requirements; and, if you have a shutdown during PC plus 2, subsequent midcourse maneuvers required with - Well, the earliest one would be PC plus 4. If you don't do a PC plus 2, but we still want to do one - MCC later. At PC plus 4, the increase in Delt - in Delta-V, or the penalty, would be about 24 feet per second, with a landing in the mid-Pacific at 142:46:30. Now, you should expect new PADs, state vectors, and targets for PC plus 2 at about GET 78. Over. [Pause.]";CMP
92442.5;CMP; Tell them to stand by.;CAPCOM
92443.5;LMP; Stand by, Vance.;CAPCOM

92453.5;LMP; Okay. How do you read?;CAPCOM
92455.5;CAPCOM; Loud and clear.;LMP
92459.5;LMP;"Okay. Burn rules. We should shut down for the following: if we have the thrust monitor at 77 percent or below; number 2, if the DPS propellant ullage pressure is less than 160 psi; 3, if the fuel oxidizer Delta-P is greater than 25, and that'll be a ground callout; 4, if the attitude error is plus or minus 10 degrees except for starting transients. Okay. Rate limits are plus or minus 10 degrees per second. And we're to shut down with the following alarms: an Engine Gimbal light, an ISS with a Program Alarm, an LGC, a CES DC, and an inverter light, if it's still on after we've tried switching inverters. If, during the burn, the engine shuts down when the Noun 97 flashes, we should Pro, do manual ullage, and Start pushbutton, push, and Descent Engine Command Override, open. If we don't do a PC-2, our next burn will it be at PC-4 for an added 24 foot per second. We'll land mid-PAC at 142:46:30. Okay. We'll have the AGS up for backup rate command, or rate damping, I guess. And the free return that we're on, if we don't - that we're on now, if we don't do PC-2 or 4, lands us at 152:02:00 in the Indian Ocean. And there's no trim requirements on this burn, and we should expect a new uplink and a new final maneuver PAD from you at 178 hours.";CAPCOM

92626.5;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM

92663.5;CDR; What?;LMP
92665.5;LMP;Okay. One word is that the - In an optimum fashion there, going through that 2-hour activation generally took somewhere from about an hour and 15 to an hour 20. [Pause.];CDR
92682.5;CAPCOM; Okay. I guess then we ought to allow you a little more than that, huh?;LMP
92692.5;LMP; No, I was thinking that we don't have to do about four pages of it, that we probably need just about that, and that will make up for the difference of any added time we need maneuvering et cetera.;CAPCOM

97702.5;CAPCOM;"Okay. Next page, power 7, panel 16. First row, close the four Quad TCA circuit breakers, that is, Quad 1, TCA; Quad 2, Quad 3, and Quad 4 TCA. Okay. Rows 2, 3, and 4 are okay. [Pause.]";CDR
97738.5;LMP;"Okay. Panel 16, top row, we want to close Quad 1 through 4 TCA breakers, and you're saying the other three rows are as is. Again, I have the exception; the Ascent ECA Control on 16 should also be Open.";CAPCOM
97756.5;CAPCOM;Okay. We concur on that, and we have a late arrival in row 3. Stand by. [Pause.];LMP
97773.5;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. One addition, third row. The S-Band Power Amp. Request that you pull that circuit breaker and leave the switch in Primary.;LMP
97791.5;LMP; Okay. Yes, that's the way we were doing it before. I'll pull the Power Amp CB, and then I'll go back to the first stage and put the Power Amp to Prime.;CAPCOM
97803.5;CAPCOM;" That's correct; that should be changed back to Prime. And that's - That's it. [Long pause.]";CDR

97857.5;LMP; We ought to probably go back to that wide deadband.;CDR
97865.5;CDR; Okay. The Bus Tie Inverters are coming off the line.;LMP
97869.5;LMP; Yes. Go ahead. Sorry, I put the switch off. That'll kill caution and warning. [Long pause.];CDR
97903.5;CDR; Okay. Let's see. So we're going to lose the ball again.;LMP
97907.5;LMP; Yes.;CDR

97976.5;CDR; Yeah.;LMP
97977.5;CDR;Why don't you give them a call, panel 11.;LMP
97980.5;LMP; Okay, Vance. I'm on - Do you read me now, hot mike?;CDR
97984.5;CAPCOM; Roger. Loud and clear, Fred.;LMP
97987.5;LMP;Okay. Jim just noticed we got a VHF breaker in on panel 11 still, I think, that probably should be opened. [Pause.];CAPCOM
98002.5;CAPCOM; Okay. That's affirmative. Pull the VHF-A receiver.;LMP
98015.5;LMP; Okay. Pull it, Jim.;CAPCOM
98016.5;CDR; I got it already. Okay. Now, why are we putting the cabin fan on?;LMP
98027.5;CDR; Oh, oh, oh. Oh, yes. Okay. [Long pause.];LMP
98044.5;CDR;Okay. I'm going to pull inverter 1.;LMP

98052.5;CDR; Okay.;LMP
98053.5;LMP; Roger...;CDR
98054.5;CDR; - but my only question is, I got the Cross Tie Bus circuit breaker in? Could be - Yes, this one right here.;LMP

98168.5;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. That's one that we're leaving up until the PTC is established. We have a procedure for PTC to try with you, which we're hopeful will work pretty well. And I'll read that up as soon as you get what you're doing now done.;LMP
98184.5;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
98185.5;CDR; Why don't you go ahead, and I'll get this PTC procedure. It's by the photo log, and I'll just get that. [Long pause.];LMP
98206.5;LMP; And one other question, Houston. You really want to pull the ASA breaker? You want to give up the AGS probably for good now, huh? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
98234.5;CDR; Houston, I'm standing by to copy the PTC procedures;CAPCOM
98240.5;CAPCOM;"Okay. I'll get back with you on your question in a minute, Fred. Now, here comes the PTC procedure. Step 1, Guidance Control to PGNS; 2, Mode Control, Att Hold; Verb 76, Enter; maneuver to PTC attitude; and that incidentally is roll 0, pitch 90, and present yaw. We realize you can't monitor that on your FDAI, but you can on a verb, with a Verb 16, Noun 20.";CDR
98281.5;CAPCOM; With me?;CDR
98301.5;CDR;"Roger. Guidance Control, PGNS; Mode Control, Att Hold, Verb 76, Enter; maneuver to PTC attitude which is roll 0, pitch 90, and yaw, which is the present yaw. Is that correct?";CAPCOM
98315.5;CAPCOM;"That's correct. Okay. Next. Mode - at - When you're established at the attitude, Mode Control, Auto. Key in Verb 16, Noun 20 to monitor rates; when less than 0.1 degree a second, rate in all - in each axis, then disable plus-X thrusters. Okay. Next, Verb 25, Noun 07, Enter; 1257, Enter; 252, Enter; 1, Enter; Verb 77, Enter; Verb 48, Enter; put in the DAP, 22110 and Proceed; Verb 34, Enter; then Verb 16, Noun 20; and monitor rates. On rates less than 0.01 degrees per second in all axis: Verb 76, Enter; Mode Control, Att Hold; then 30 clicks of right yaw to start the maneuver. Over. [Long pause.]";CDR
98489.5;CDR;"Okay, Vance. PTC procedure: Guidance Control, PGNS; Mode Control, Att Hold; Verb 76, Enter; maneuver to PTC attitude; roll 0, pitch 90, yaw 0; my ball now, of course, is inoperative, so I'll have to get that on the DSKY. The 5 is Mode Control, Auto; 6: Verb 16, Noun 20, monitor rates; rates less than 1 degree per second in each axis, disable, and I didn't hear that last part. The next one was Verb 25, Noun 07, Enter; 1257, Enter; 252, Enter; 1, Enter; Verb 77, Enter; Verb 48, Enter; 22110, Proceed; Verb 34, Enter; Verb 16, Noun 20, Enter; monitor rates. Rates less than 0.01 degrees per second in all axis. Verb 76, Enter; Mode Control, Att Hold; then 30 clicks of right yaw to stop - to start - maneuvers.";CAPCOM
98565.5;CAPCOM;Roger. That's correct, Jim. To - to answer your questions and correct one point, yaw should be your present yaw, whatever it is, and that's up with roll 0, pitch 90, present yaw. The other thing is, you said disable and you didn't hear the rest. That's disable plus-X thrusters. And finally, near the end, the 22110 refers to DAP loading. [Pause.];CDR
98609.5;CDR;Roger. Now, to maneuver to PTC roll 0, pitch 90 and yaw is - and pitch is here, roll is here. Yaw - whatever yaw we have in. Okay, Vance. In our initial maneuver to PTC attitude, I am going to have to use - to display 16 20 and I'll have to use the TTCA to get there. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
98682.5;CAPCOM;Jim, Roger. Your use of the TC - TTCA and just a reminder that in maneuvering that - that - that roll is in R3 and yaw is in R1.;CDR
98698.5;CDR; That's affirm. And I'm going to take out roll first to get it zero and then I'm going to take care of pitch.;CAPCOM
98705.5;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];CDR
98748.5;CDR;"Okay. Guidance Control, PGNS; Mode Control to Att Hold. Verb 73 clears. Okay. We've got to get that out. [Garble] it stopped moving. [Pause.]";CAPCOM

98916.5;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;CDR
98920.5;CDR; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
98922.5;CAPCOM;Okay. A couple of things, Jim. One is that you can use the TTCAs to maneuver, but you're going to save a lot of fuel if you'd try Minimum Impulse. So, that might be a better recommendation. The other thing is, we'd like to give you a Go before you disable the plus S - X thrusters, and before you do a Verb 76, and Mode Control to Att Hold. Over. [Pause.];CDR
98961.5;CDR;"Okay; understand. You want a Go before I - I'm - Of course, I just did a 76, and the Mode Control is in Att Hold, at this time. But, this is later on down. [Pause.]";CAPCOM
98985.5;CAPCOM;"Yes. All we wanted to do was take a look at things before you disabled the plus-X thrusters, and before you go to Min Impulse at the end there - that Verb 76, Enter; Mode Control, Att Hold.";CDR

99052.5;LMP; Ah...;CAPCOM
99053.5;CAPCOM; Go ahead.;LMP
99054.5;LMP; In what fashion did you want us to disable those plus-X thrusters? Just pulling those appropriate TCA breakers, or did you want to actually go in and mask those jets? [Pause.];CAPCOM
99074.5;CAPCOM;Okay, Fred. We didn't explain that. The Verb 25, Noun 07, Enter sequence does that.;LMP
99084.5;LMP; Okay. I didn't read the whole procedure. Jim just mentioned he wanted to disable plus-X.;CDR
99090.5;CDR; I just did.;LMP

100062.5;CAPCOM; Jim, we don't have any data on your movements right now. How does it look like this procedure's going to work out so far as getting an attitude set up, the first part of the procedure?;CDR
100080.5;CDR;Well, Vance, I've been trying to use Minimum Impulse only attitude control to get my roll and yaw - the roll and pitch, rather. But, with the attitude control only in this configuration, I - I can't command these - the roll the way I want to. So, I had to go to TTCA to get my roll to build up towards zero, it was going - decreasing towards 270. I really don't know what the combination is in the attitude control, that you can get the control to pitch and roll the way you want it to. You've got to use the TTCA.;CAPCOM
100121.5;CAPCOM; Roger. Copy.;CDR
100125.5;CDR;I now have both pitch and yaw - or pitch and roll going toward the designated amounts, now passing through 23 degrees in pitch, and I'm going up past 321 degrees in roll.

100442.5;CDR;Okay. Vance, I tried that but when I start doing roll only I get pitch coupled in with it. But both of them rolling up toward this desired amount, though. I'm up to 46 and in pitch and 326 in roll.;CAPCOM
100463.5;CAPCOM; Okay. Understand you've tried it. [Pause.];CDR

100630.5;CAPCOM; Yes. I do now. Go ahead.;LMP
100634.5;LMP; Okay. You guys just tell me what sort of material you had in mind to build this mailbox out of, and Jack and I will go to work on trying to construct that thing. Assume we'll use the space-age baling wire or the gray tape?;CAPCOM
100652.5;CAPCOM;" That's affirm. We have a lengthy procedure here; but, in short, you use plastic as a covering for the whole thing. You put some kind of a stiffener at the top so the plastic doesn't suck against the LOI - LiOH enter - entrance side. You'll - You need gray tape to stick the whole thing together, and you need something like a sock to put in the - the bottom so that the outlet side is plugged up. As it turns out, the flow is rather U-shaped through the cartridge, Fred. It, if you plug up the bottom, it comes in one side of the top and goes out the other.";LMP

100748.5;LMP; Okay. [Pause.];CDR
100759.5;CDR;And to answer your question about PTC, Vance, it's rather difficult to use yaw in zero right away. So what I'm doing, yaw is working toward zero, right now.

101653.5;LMP; (Laughter). [Long pause.];CDR
101675.5;LMP; Okay. What we're going to do, Jack, [garble] over there [garble]. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
101700.5;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;LMP
101706.5;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
101707.5;CAPCOM; Jim, it looks pretty good except that the pitch is going out in the wrong direction, now. Over.;CDR
101718.5;CDR; I concur. What I'm going to do is get roll to zero and I'm trying to bring yaw into zero and as soon as I get those two pretty well matched up, then I'm going to take the pitch and try to pitch it down.;CAPCOM
101730.5;CAPCOM; Okeydoke.;CDR
101834.5;CDR;" Okay. Now I've got pitch going down; I've got roll almost zero and yaw is almost zero.";CAPCOM
101843.5;CAPCOM; Okay. Copy, there, Jim.;CDR
101870.9;CDR; Houston, what's an acceptable pitch attitude, that you'll take? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
101900.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. [Long pause.];CDR
101916.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;CDR
101921.9;CDR;Roger. What's the acceptable pitch attitude that we can have for PTC? I can go into Auto any time now, I'm looking at 118 degrees in pitch, practically zero roll, and about 40 degrees of yaw. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
101935.9;CAPCOM; Ninety degrees pitch.;CDR
101941.9;CDR;I'm looking at 118 degrees of pitch. [Pause.];CAPCOM
101952.9;CAPCOM; Stand by. [Long pause.];CDR
101970.9;CDR; I'm trying to talk to them.;CAPCOM
101973.9;CAPCOM;Stand by a minute, Jim. The pitch is the important thing, but - but stand by 1.;CDR
101983.9;CDR; Okay. It's coming down. What's that? Well, I guess I'd better eat something. Hey, this one has some of that candied jelly [garble] you know, we've gone a hell of a long time without any sleep. I said we've gone a hell of a long time without any sleep. [Pause.];CAPCOM
102011.9;CDR; We'll have to start thinking about getting the [garble] back to sleep again because - I know - I - I didn't get hardly any sleep last night at all.;CAPCOM
102025.9;CDR; Hey, Fred? These jettison bags with the - are real airtight stuff, if you want to use them for wrapping for a lithium hydroxide bag or something like that.;CAPCOM
102042.9;CDR; Yes, this stuff is really tight. [Pause.];CAPCOM
102055.9;CDR; Yes.;CAPCOM
102072.3;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;CDR
102076.3;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
102077.3;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. Would you stable your - stabilize your rates here at the attitudes you're at now and go Att Hold. Over.;CDR
102089.3;CDR;Okay. Will do. I'm now at 103 degrees - 106 degrees pitch, and 2.5 degrees roll.;CAPCOM
102096.3;CAPCOM; Roger. [Long pause.];LMP
102124.3;LMP; [Garble]?;CAPCOM

102196.3;CDR; [Garble] mine are [garble]. Hey, I got you a clean one.;LMP
102202.3;LMP; Okay.;CDR
102203.3;CDR; Last one's in the trash bag. Oh, I thought - if you wanted a [garble], you'll have to use the lithium hydroxide [garble]. [Long pause.];LMP
102258.3;CDR;Okay, Houston. Are you monitoring my angles? It appears that it might be less then 1 degree per second.;CAPCOM
102270.3;CAPCOM; Stand by. We'll check them, Jim. [Long pause.];CDR
102329.3;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;CDR
102334.3;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
102336.3;CAPCOM; Jim, that's affirm. We're monitoring and you're almost there, but we'd like to let them stabilize a little bit longer. Over.;CDR
102348.3;CDR; Okay. We'll - We'll just hold.;CAPCOM
102351.3;CAPCOM; And if - if you can now go into your eat period or do something else while the rates are stabilizing, why, we recommend you relax somewhere and get some chow.;CDR
102367.3;CDR; Right-o. We'll do that.;CAPCOM
102543.3;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;CDR
102548.3;CDR; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
102550.3;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim. Looks like your rates are damped sufficient. Recommend that you go ahead with the 'Verb 25, Noun 07, Enter' bit, on down through the 'Verb 34, Enter', and then wish you'd stand by for us to look at it again before you go beyond that. Over.;CDR
102576.3;CDR;Okay, Houston. I'll go through Verb 25, Noun 07, down through Verb 34, Enter, and I'll stand by.;CAPCOM
102587.3;CAPCOM; Right-o. [Long pause.];CDR
102646.3;CDR; Okay, Houston. That's complete.;CAPCOM
102655.3;CAPCOM; Roger. Houston copies, and we'll...;CDR
102658.3;CDR; You [garble] monitor our rates?;CAPCOM
102659.3;CAPCOM; Roger. [Pause.];CDR
102668.3;CAPCOM; We...;CDR
102669.3;CDR;"You want to monitor the rates; we're 16 20.";CAPCOM
102672.3;CAPCOM; Roger. That's the way it should be done, and we're standing by for the rates to damp out some more.;CDR
102681.3;CDR; Okay. [Long pause.];CMP
102711.3;CMP; How you coming?;CDR
102716.3;CDR; Oh, we're taking stock of how much we got there, maybe sort of think about rationing some of it. I mean just to make sure we've got enough to last us and that we get enough water out. I'd hate to run out of water on the last day. Take a look and see how much we got, and fill them up and just hold them there. Yes, and I'll tell you the stuff that's good to eat now will be the candies, the sandwich spreads. Maybe the freeze - the dehydrated stuff. If you have to rehydrate it, it'd be kind of difficult. No, wet packs are good. [Long pause.];CMP
102804.3;CDR; As a matter of fact, we might use those little - Well, how about the PLSSs? [Pause.];CMP
102814.3;CDR; Yes, I know, but I mean the PLSSs are bombs, too.;CMP
102819.3;CMP; [Garble].;CDR
102821.3;CDR; We're damping rates.;CMP
102824.3;CMP; [Garble].;CDR
102827.3;CDR; Well, maybe we ought to use the OPS first.;CMP
102831.9;CDR; You guys moving around? [Pause.];CMP
102841.9;CDR; Okay.;CMP
102919.9;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston. Over.;CDR
102924.9;CDR; Go ahead, Vance.;CAPCOM
102926.9;CAPCOM; Jim, just a reminder. Any waste water dumped at this point would really jiggle up the PTC preparation, so request you save that until we're spun up. Over.;CDR
102943.9;CDR; Right. I don't think we're doing any.;CAPCOM
102946.9;CAPCOM; No. No, I don't, think so, but I just wanted to make sure, you were aware of it - I thought you were.;CDR
102957.9;CDR; We're saving all the water we can.;CMP
103086.9;CMP; [Garble] for a minute?;CDR
103090.9;CDR; With the new space [garble], we're [garble]. We've just about slowed down. You're damping right.;LMP
103187.9;LMP; There she is. [Long pause.];CDR
103228.9;LMP; And, Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
103233.9;CAPCOM; Houston. Go ahead.;LMP
103237.9;LMP;" Okay, Vance. A couple of items we uncovered for that cartridge mod. One is the special dust covering bag that we were going to use on the tote bags, that is pretty thick and nonporous; and we went up to the upstairs kitchen and drained water a couple of more times, and made up a whole bunch of drink bags, again; and from the pantry, we retrieved a fairly large - enclosed - enclosure made of plastic that those drink bags are in that I think we can scissor and also make do for a cover, taping it on, if that's appropriate.";CAPCOM
103288.9;CAPCOM; Okay. Jack Lousma here has a refined version of the procedure on how to make these the easy way, and I think before too long he ought to be reading that up to you. If...;LMP
103306.9;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
103307.9;CAPCOM; It's not time critical to get this up to you. It's just that, before you get too far in assembling these on your own, we'd kind of like to give you the benefit of experience down here.;LMP
103324.9;LMP; Okay. Who - Who built them back there.;CAPCOM
103331.9;CAPCOM; Tony did some of it, and Jack's been working on it, too. So we've had a big effort on it.;LMP
103341.9;LMP; Great. [Pause.];CAPCOM
103351.9;CAPCOM; We would encourage you to wait until tomorrow to receive that procedure, but we can send it up sooner, if you insist. Over.;LMP
103361.9;LMP; No, that's all right, Vance. Before we have to worry about that I guess we got another primary and three secondaries to go through.;CAPCOM
103372.9;CAPCOM; That's right. [Long pause.];LMP
103392.9;CDR; You know, sometimes those cartridges have - I guess they rejuvenate.;CAPCOM
103403.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;CDR
103406.9;LMP; Man, that's a wicked low pressure down there.;CDR
103412.9;CDR; I wish I was on it.;LMP
103416.9;LMP; (Laughter).;CAPCOM
103418.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;LMP
103421.9;LMP; [Garble] up [garble].;CDR
103423.9;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
103424.9;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim. Your rates are once again looking good so we can continue on with the rest of this procedure. Request you go ahead with the Verb 76, Enter, and Mode Control, to Att Hold, and then the last step, 30 clicks yaw right.;LMP
103447.9;LMP; Jets are firing again.;CAPCOM
103452.9;CDR;Okay. I'll do a Verb 76, Enter with the Mode Control Att Hold and then 30 clicks of right yaw to set the maneuver.;CAPCOM
103460.9;CAPCOM;Verb 76, Enter.;CDR
103465.9;CDR; Roger.;CAPCOM
103470.9;CDR;There's your Verb 76, Enter. Mode Control to Att Hold. Now you want me to do 30 clicks of right yaw? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
103492.9;CDR; Vance, did you say for me to hold on the right yaw or do you want me to start it now?;CAPCOM
103498.9;CAPCOM; No, no need to hesitate, you can start now.;CDR
103504.9;CDR; Okay. [Pause.];CAPCOM
103514.9;CAPCOM; After you get that going, then we'll think about powering down the PGNS. [Long pause.];CDR
103533.9;CDR;Okay. There were 30 clicks of right yaw.;CAPCOM
103537.9;CAPCOM; Okay. We'd like to look at it for just a little while before we power down the PGNS, so stand by. [Pause.];CDR
103554.9;CDR; Understand you're planning to power down the PGNS?;CAPCOM
103560.9;CAPCOM; Right. We want to get the amps down.;CDR
103563.9;CDR; Okay.;LMP

103583.9;LMP; You want to bring all the film back empty?;CDR
103592.9;LMP; I'd like to just [garble] and shoot it.;CDR
103596.9;LMP; Every last lousy one of them. [Long pause.];CDR

103632.9;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CDR
103651.9;LMP; Hey, Jim.;CDR
103654.9;CDR; Yes, we'll probably get there [garble].;CAPCOM

103788.9;LMP; You got it, Vance?;CAPCOM
103790.9;CAPCOM; Roger. That did it. Thank you. [Long pause.];LMP
103821.9;CMP; Gad, there's Ptolemaeus and Alphonsus.;LMP

103865.9;CMP; Here, let me shoot a few pictures of the old Moon here.;CDR
103869.9;CDR; Yes. (cough) Which ones [garble]. Did you put it back ?;LMP
103873.9;LMP; Yes.;CDR
103875.9;CDR; Looks like we got [garble] to do with Earth? Ptolemaeus?;LMP
103878.9;LMP; We need it to align again. [Long pause.];CDR
103896.9;CDR; You don't think that burn was enough, do you? Was that a midcourse?;LMP
103897.9;LMP; The RCS is worse.;CDR
103904.9;CDR; The RCS [garble] attitude. [Long pause.];LMP
103943.9;LMP; [Garble] ought to come up the side. Then, you got us in the right plane, Jim. We're in the right plane. We're pointed off and we'll swerve on again with the Earth, Moon, and Sun. [Long pause.];CDR

103989.9;CMP; How's that?;CDR
103991.9;CDR; Awful.;CMP
103993.9;LMP; Oh, that's right. That blasted service - Command Module is back there. Scratch that one. That one?;CDR
104007.9;CDR; It's not much better. Okay, let's go this one.;LMP
104012.9;LMP; Keep the [garble].;CAPCOM
104015.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;LMP
104020.9;CDR; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
104021.9;CAPCOM; Jim, we have some status information for you, if you're ready to copy on a piece of scratch paper.;CDR
104032.9;LMP; Stand by, Vance.;CAPCOM
104033.9;CAPCOM; Okay.;LMP
104038.9;CDR; We're ready for you.;LMP
104040.9;LMP; Put that away and get some status paper here.;CDR
104045.9;CDR; Go ahead, Vance.;CAPCOM
104047.9;CAPCOM;Okay. First, midcourse correction will probably be at GET 104 hours, and all we look for is a 4 to 6 feet per second Delta-V. Okay. That's the first item. Now, I will give you a rundown on consumables. Okay. In the LM, you have 1498 - that is 1 4 9 8 amp-hours remaining. That means over 61 hours you'd - That would average out to 24.5 amps. We expect that, after powerdown, that you will use 1 4 or 14 amps per hour, and that would leave a reserve of 500 amp-hours at the end of the mission. Are you with me?;CDR
104123.9;CDR; Roger. We're with you.;LMP
104124.9;LMP; I saved my - number was yesterday.;CDR
104127.9;CAPCOM; Okay. In the LM, you have...;CDR
104130.9;CDR; We're with you.;CAPCOM
104131.9;CAPCOM;Roger. In the LM, you have 215, that is 2 1 5, pounds of water, usable. That would average out over 61 hours to 3.5 pounds per hour available. Okay. [Pause.];CDR
104169.9;CAPCOM;Okay. And after you power down, we expect that you will be using water at the rate of 3.2 to 2.7 pounds - That's at 14 amps per hour electrical usage rate. One note, this does not - When we speak here of water available, this does not include CSM water and PLSS water, so that's added on. Okay, next, LiOH. Using the CSM cans, you will have 16 cans at 12 hours per can to give you 1 9 2, or 192 hours, of LiOH. And, in the LM, using its cans, you have 44 hours remaining. [Pause.];CDR
104243.9;CDR; Vance, is that with the PLSS secondaries?;CAPCOM
104248.9;CAPCOM; That's affirm. That's affirm. That includes PLSS secondaries. [Pause.];CDR
104261.9;CAPCOM;"Okay; oxygen. You have remaining 44 pounds in the LM. At a usage rate of 0.36 pounds per hour, that leaves you 120, or 1 2 0, hours of oxygen. Okay. Next, RCS. RCS A stands at 6 2 percent and B at 6 2 percent. We only expect 2 percent to be used for the PTC, so you're in good shape for RCS. Next, DPS Delta-V. You have 1190 feet per second remaining. And, finally, CSM EPS. We estimate that you have 99 amp-hours. That's an estimate. And that's it. Over.";CDR
104353.9;CDR; Okay. I copy.;CAPCOM
104358.9;CAPCOM;" Okay. And just a question. It would be interesting to hear from Jack to see if he thinks that Main B bus is good. If he has any idea of how, if whether it's good or not, this would influence our steps in the future; for example, we might want to try to test Main B to see if it is, in fact, good so that we'd know how to set switches for entry.";CDR
104394.9;CDR; Roger. Just a minute. They want to know whether you think Main Bus B is any good for the Command Module. [Pause.];CAPCOM
104408.9;CDR; Vance, while Jack's got on the loop, let me pose the question of how we're planning on doing this midcourse, if we are going to power down the PGNS.;CAPCOM
104421.9;CAPCOM; Would you stand by on that, Jim? We'd like to give you a procedure for that later on.;CDR
104428.9;CDR;Okay. Got a midcourse at 104 hours, He's going to give us a procedure for that later on.;CAPCOM
104442.9;CAPCOM; In short, Jim, we don't expect any problem, but we'll explain further later on.;CDR
104454.9;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
104456.9;CAPCOM; Deke says get a night's sleep. He says you've been working hard, and you ought to relax a little bit and be ready for tomorrow.;CDR
104471.9;CMP; Vance, this is Jack.;CAPCOM
104473.9;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Jack.;CMP
104477.9;CMP;Okay. Let me give you my observations on Main Bus B. Things happened pretty fast there, and we first heard the impact or explosion or whatever caused it, I'm not sure. The next - About 1 second later, there was a Master Alarm which was the Main Bus B Undervolt. I looked at the voltage, and the voltage was good at this time so I'm suspecting it was a spike. Fuel cell 3 was also good, with good flow. However, Fred, at that point, was coming into the Command Module and got over into his seat. At that time, we shortly had an AC Bus 2 light about the time he got into his seat. He looked at the Main Bus B and the Main Bus B was reading zero. It, however, - and the fuel cell flows were zero. I'm kind of suspecting that perhaps we do have a Main - a current Main Bus B. But that's merely a guess. I never did try to reset it. We were having other problems with the Main Bus A, having an Undervolt and a few other things like that. I'd kind of like to hear what your feelings are down there.;CAPCOM
104569.9;CAPCOM; Well, Jack, we copy your information. And we'd like to hold off because we're still working the problem. So we'll have to give you information later. [Pause.];CMP
104588.9;CAPCOM; Thank you.;CMP
104597.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, request Aft Omni. [Pause.];CMP
104611.9;CMP; Vance, are you back with me?;CAPCOM
104614.9;CAPCOM; Roger. We're with you.;CMP
104618.9;CMP; Okay. We lost lock there. We switched Omnis. Just for my own - kind of to get my thoughts in order, I'd kind of hear what - I'd like to hear what kind of entry you're planning. EMS or PGNCS or what?;CAPCOM
104636.9;CAPCOM; Okay. PGNCS entry is being planned, and people are at work on checklist changes and that sort of thing.;CMP
104648.9;CMP; Okay. Real fine.;CAPCOM
104651.9;CAPCOM; And - we'll - We'll give you the CSM stuff tomorrow, but basically we expect that Main Bus B is good and we're going to work up a procedure to test it.;CMP
104666.9;CMP; Okay. Those are my thoughts, too.;LMP
104668.9;CAPCOM; Roger...;LMP
104670.9;CMP; You think Main Bus B is good, don't you?;CAPCOM
104673.9;CAPCOM; That's affirm. We think it is, but we want to check it out anyway.;CMP
104676.9;SC; We think you guys are in great shape, all the way around. Why don't you quit worrying and go to sleep.;CMP
104680.9;CMP; Okay, Vance.;SC
104685.9;CMP; Oh, that - That's our boss, Deke.;CDR
104692.9;CDR; Well, I think we just might do that - or part of us will. [Long pause.];CMP
104719.9;CMP; I mixed up. How many more of those - Are we hot mike?;CDR
104722.9;CDR; Yes. [Pause.];CMP
104730.9;CMP;Yes, I'm mixed up. You had 15? I mixed up seven more. So we got 22. By the way, there's still some water that's - it's not enough pressure to mix up another drink, but there is some water out of there, if you want to get some water out of the drink cup.;CDR
104753.9;CDR;" That's good; I could use some.";CMP

104847.9;LMP; Did you get some? Is there any coming out still? They didn't answer. I think we made it. How's this working out?;CDR
104866.9;CDR; Okay. No problem.;LMP
104869.9;CMP; They are, huh? How are we going to get an alignment?;CDR
104877.9;CDR; We'll pull one out some ways, I guess. We've gotta watch that one right there.;CMP
104892.9;LMP; It's decreasing now. It'll - it'll - It's cold. I noticed that in the Command Module. It'll wobble. [Long pause.];CDR

105048.9;CDR; Okay. I'm changing those to - back again. First three rows. And you're pulling the ATCA PGNS, huh.;CAPCOM
105058.9;CAPCOM; That's affirmative. Pull ATCA PGNS open.;CDR
105065.9;CDR; Okay. I've done that.;CAPCOM
105074.9;CAPCOM; Okay. Are you ready for the fourth row?;CDR
105079.9;CDR; Affirm.;CAPCOM
105081.9;CAPCOM;"Okay. Now when we get in the fourth row, we're going to open the IMU OPERATE circuit breaker; and what that means is that we're going to lose the capability to watch your CDUs, so we're not going to be able to see your attitude. Therefore, we will not be able to advise you on which antenna to select for communications. The way we want you to handle that is to turn the LM Uplink Squelch off, and when you hear the noise, switch antennas. We'll be able to see you switch antennas, and it's going to take us about 3 to 5 minutes to establish a lockon again after you switch. After each time that you switch antennas, we will initiate a voice check. And basically when you see the Earth out the window, you can be on Forward antenna, and when the Moon's up in the window use the Aft antenna. You copy? [Pause.]";CDR
105155.9;CDR; Okay. We're going to pull the IMU OPERATE circuit breaker, so you won't be able to see our attitude. Therefore, you won't tell us how to switch antennas and we'll enable the - I will turn the - up the Squelch Off so that when we start getting any static, we'll switch antennas and as a thumb rule we could use - with the Earth forward, we use the Forward antenna and when we see the Moon we use the Aft antenna.;CAPCOM
105186.9;CAPCOM;That's affirmative, Jim. In other words, we're leaving the antenna switching up to you, and after you switch antennas it's going to take 3 to 5 minutes for us to establish a lockon again, and we'll initiate a voice check. And I'm ready to go on panel 11, row 4.;CDR
105208.9;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
105210.9;CAPCOM;"Okay. On row 4, under Heaters RCS System A/B-1: open Quad 1 through 4; under ECS, the only change is - under Glycol Pump, close Auto Transfer; under Comm, the only change is: open VHF A Receiver, open Commander Audio; under PGNS, the only change is: close and leave closed IMU Standby circuit breaker, so we can have heaters. Read back. [Pause.]";CDR
105264.9;CDR;Okay. On row 4, we're going to open all four off the heaters - the RCS System A and B - the first four circuit breakers. We're going to close the Auto Transfer. We're going to open the VHF A Receiver and the Commander Audio. And we're going to close the IMU Standby. The LGC DSKY and the IMU Operate will be open.;CAPCOM
105299.9;CAPCOM;That's affirmative, Jim. All other breakers in that row are as you see them in the checklist. And on row 5, the only change is that we want you to, under EPS, open Ascent ECA Control. Over. [Pause.];CDR
105319.9;CDR; Roger. I think we already have that opened - Ascent ECA Control is probably already open. [Pause.];CAPCOM
105330.9;CDR;" Okay. So let me confirm. We'll have one Comm system, that will be the LMP system, and we'll have to do our own antenna switching; therefore, we'll have to wait about - Okay, why don't you switch? Aft antenna.";CAPCOM
105358.9;CDR; We'll have to wait for you to get a lockon again. Is that correct?;CAPCOM
105368.9;CAPCOM; That's affirmative, Jim. You'll be working off of the LMP's panel over there.;CDR
105376.9;CDR; Okay. What else do you have for me?;CAPCOM
105378.9;CAPCOM;Okay. Panel 16, that's on page Power-7. Top row, the only change is: under RCS System B, open PQGS/Displays. Over. [Pause.];CDR
105404.9;CDR;"Okay. I may go over this with you, Jack, because this checklist has been written over two or three times now on our various procedures. Top row, the first two are open, the next three are closed, and we're going to open now the Quad TCA's 1, 2, 3, 4; Crossfeed will be closed, and the Temp/Press Displayflag will be opened, and we're going  to open up the PQGS, Main SOV will be closed, and the [garble] will be opened.";CAPCOM
105440.9;CAPCOM; That's affirmative, Jim. And there's no change to the second row. Over. [Pause.];CDR
105452.9;CDR; Okay. Again, let me go through this with you. The first four are going to be closed. The next sev - eight will be - the next nine will be open from Logic Power B through Descent Engine Override. How about the CWEA? Is that going to be closed?;CAPCOM
105482.9;CAPCOM; That's affirmative, Jim. We want the next five closed.;CDR
105489.9;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
105490.9;CAPCOM;" Okay. In the third row, under Comm: Display, Open; SE Audio, Closed; VHF A Transmitter, Open - That's a change - VHF B Receiver, Open; Primary S-Band, Power Amplifier, Open; Transmitter/Receiver, Closed; S-Band Antenna, Open; PMP, Closed; TV, Open. Under ECS: Displays, Open; Glycol Pump Secondary, Open; LGC Pump, Open; Cabin Fan Control, Open; Cabin Repress, Closed; and all the next four, Closed also. Read back.";CDR
105546.9;CDR;" Okay. We have Display, Open; SE Audio, Closed; VHF A Transmitter, Open; VHF B Receiver, Open; Power Amp's going to be Open; Transmitter/Receiver, Closed; S-Band Antenna, Open; PMP, Closed; TV, Open; Display is Open; next three are Open; Cabin Repress, Closed; and all the rest, Closed.";CAPCOM
105570.9;CAPCOM;That's affirmative, Jim. And in row 4, under Heaters, we want them all - Correction - we want all the Quad Heaters, Open. Correction - we want all the Quad Heaters, Closed.;CDR
105587.9;CDR; All the...;CAPCOM
105588.9;CAPCOM;"We want Display, Open; S-Band Antenna, Closed - to avoid a Master Alarm, Camera - Sequence Camera, Open; And under EPS, we want Displays, Open; DC Bus Volt, Closed; Inverter 2, Open; Ascent ECA, Closed; Ascent ECA Control, Open; Descent ECA, Closed; Descent ECA Control, Closed; Translunar Bus Tie, Close; we want the Cross Tie Bus, Open; the Bal Loads, Closed; Bat Feed Ties, Closed. How do you read?";CDR
105640.9;CDR;"Okay. The four RCS Heaters will be Closed; Displays, Open; S-Band Antenna, Closed; Camera Sequence will be Open; Display will be Open; DC Bus Volt will be Closed; Inverter 2, Open; Ascent ECA will be Closed, but the Ascent ECA Control, Open; Descent ECA, Closed; Descent ECA Control, Closed; Translunar Bus Tie, Closed; and Cross Tie Bus, Open; and Balance Loads, Closed; and the Bat Feed Ties, Closed. I have one question, Jack. On panel - on the second line there under Lighting, why are we keeping: the Floods and Track closed? Or are they going to be open?";CAPCOM
105687.9;CAPCOM; Negative. We have the, Lighting breakers all closed. Control the lighting with the switches and rheostats. Over.;CDR
105698.9;CDR; Okay. We don't need the floodlights, I don't think, but we can do it that way, I guess.;CAPCOM
105705.9;CAPCOM;And under row 4, under RCS Systems A/B-2, Quad Heaters, you notice that we've closed those circuit breakers, but what we want you to do is to - on panel 3, turn the RCS A/B-2 Quad switches 1, 2, 3, and 4, off. Over. [Pause.];CDR
105742.9;CAPCOM;And we're going to watch your quad temps for you, and when we need to warm them up a little bit, we'll tell you to throw those four switches on - on panel 3.;CDR
105757.9;CDR; Okay. Now are we sure that this PTC mode is good enough so we don't [garble] get crossed up later and get out of configuration.;CAPCOM
105767.9;CAPCOM;Stand by 1 on that, Jim. Okay, Jim, as far as we can tell right now, the PTC looks as good as any PTC we've ever seen in a CSM, so we're going to go with what we've got.;CDR
105790.9;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
105792.9;CAPCOM;Okay, and if you turn over the page on Power 8, we have the spacecraft functions remaining to you. We've got low bit rate TM. However, we don't have any VHF. We have CWEA. We have Glycol Pumps. We have Suit Fans. We have Cabin Repress for you, and stand by in Attitude Control here. Okay, in Attitude Control, we'll have hardovers for uses in emergency, and for normal usage we want to have a 15-minute delay to get the heaters on to warm them up before use. How do you read?;CDR
105840.9;CDR;Okay. For emergency, we have the hardovers and for normal use it requires a 15-minute request to get the heaters on.;CAPCOM
105850.9;CAPCOM; That's affirmative. [Pause.];CDR
105862.9;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim, that concludes our powerdown procedure, and we're waiting for you to get with it;CDR
105871.9;CDR; Okay, Jack, we'll start. I sure hate to lose the PGNS. I sure hope that procedure for the midcourse is a good one.;CAPCOM
105879.9;CAPCOM; It is. [Pause.];CMP
105889.9;CMP; You want me to help you here?;CAPCOM
105891.9;CDR;Yes, you can - Okay. First we power down panel 11. All of them open. [Pause.];CMP

106032.9;CDR; I'll give you this when I'm finished. After we go through this, then you can go through it again and double check it.;CMP
106037.9;CMP; Right. [Long pause.];CDR
106081.9;CMP; Now, the flood lights are on, right? No, I kind of don't think we need them though, do you?;CDR
106089.9;CDR; Don't pull those. Give me the - first of all. We'll get back there. Those four are Close, Open, Open, Engine Arm, Open, [garble];LMP
106230.9;CDR;" Say, Houston; Aquarius.";CAPCOM
106232.9;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CMP
106234.9;CMP; It will take him a minute to [garble].;CAPCOM
106237.9;CDR;You're familiar with our particular spacecraft that on panel 16 Heaters RCS Systems A and B, Quad 1 Heater circuit breaker has been pushed in, and sealed in, and if it's ever pushed out, it's doubtful if we'll ever be able to reset it. [Pause.];CAPCOM
106260.9;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim, on the four Quad Heater breakers, we want you to leave them closed. And we'll operate the heaters with the switches on panel 3. Over.;CDR
106273.9;CDR; Okay. [Pause.];CMP
106281.9;CMP; No. [Long pause.];CDR
106321.9;CDR; Okay. We'll do it right there.;CAPCOM
106325.9;CDR;Okay. And I'm closing the Heaters on panel 4, Quad 1 through 4, Off.;CAPCOM
106337.9;CAPCOM; Okay. It's time for you guys to get to bed and get Fred up.;CDR
106347.9;CDR;(Laughter) I still have one question, Jack. I still think that - I still say that the - on the Lighting in our panel 16, the Flood lights and the Track should be open. We're not using them.;CAPCOM
106362.9;FLIGHT; Do you have any argument about...;CAPCOM
106367.9;CAPCOM; No problem, Jim. Go ahead and open them, Track and Flood, that's all right.;FLIGHT
106377.9;CMP; Okay, Track and Flood are Open.;CDR
106381.9;CDR; Now, why don't you go through that, Jack, and make sure those...;CMP
106384.9;CMP; Yes.;CDR
106386.9;CDR; ...[garble].;CMP
106389.9;CMP; Okay, I'll take this.;CDR
106390.9;CDR;Okay, Jack, my only other concern now is the CO<sub>2</sub> rise in the spacecraft. I guess you're keeping a handle on that?;CMP
106400.9;CAPCOM;That's affirmed, Jim. We have up to 10.6 now, and we're willing to go a little higher on that. We have another cartridge and we have a procedure for making the Command Module cartridges up. We'll pass that on later.;CDR
106416.9;CDR; Oh, yes. I'm not worried about that. I just wanted to make sure that you...;CAPCOM
106420.9;CMP; Are they going to...;CDR
106421.9;CDR;...that - We just don't want to go to sleep here and forget about the rise in CO<sub>2</sub>.;CMP
106425.9;CMP; Are they going to use [garble]...;CAPCOM
106426.9;CAPCOM; Roger. We're watching it for you...;CMP
106428.9;CDR; Yes, they're getting it [garble].;CAPCOM
106429.9;CAPCOM;- We have it here. It's now 10.7 and we have a medical Go to 15 millimeters.;CDR
106437.9;CMP; That's a new one.;CDR
106438.9;CDR; There's a new first for you. [Long pause.];CMP
106453.9;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim, we estimate we've got 1 more hour on the primary cartridge, and 6 or 7 hours on the secondary.;CDR
106465.9;CDR; Okay. Fine. Say, it's a spare primary cartridge back there, too, isn't it? So that's good for another, how long? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
106504.9;CMP; Yes. Yes. That's yours though, isn't it?;CAPCOM
106508.9;CAPCOM; And you're right, Jim. We've got another primary cartridge back there behind the ascent engine cover.;CMP
106515.9;CDR; Right, yes. We know. Thank you. [Long pause.];CMP
106537.9;CMP; Yes, yes, I just - [Pause.];CDR
106545.9;CMP; Okay. I guess you've done everything right on that panel. Let me check the middle one. Yes. You powered down and then you leave me. Tell me, I've got it.;CAPCOM
106559.9;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack, we just thought it's about time you got a LM checkout. [Pause.];CMP
106570.9;CMP; But he's giving it to me inert. Of course, I'm giving him my Command Module, too, which is rather inert right now, too. [Pause.];CAPCOM
106586.9;CAPCOM; Well, you've got to walk before you run, you know.;CMP
106601.1;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. [Long pause.];CMP
106626.1;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;CMP
106634.1;CMP; Go ahead, Jack.;CAPCOM
106638.1;CAPCOM; Roger. For your information, Jack...;CMP
106639.1;CMP; You're loud and clear.;CAPCOM
106640.1;CAPCOM;...all of our analysis is based on powerdown to 14 amps, but we're reading on you right now 12.3 and so we're better off than we were in our analysis.;CMP
106657.1;CMP; That sounds good. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
106691.1;CMP; Jack, I thought you were going to get the sleep shift where there wasn't any excitement?;CAPCOM
106697.1;CAPCOM; Well, I tried, but I didn't make it. I thought you were supposed to be sleeping now.;CMP
106710.1;CMP; Well, Freddo is getting something to eat, and Jim is starting to sack out so I'm taking the comm here until Fred gets set.;CAPCOM
106721.1;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];CMP
106758.1;CMP; As I just - Yes, are you ready to take over? Well, he just - he just asked - said he thought I was supposed to be sleeping. And I told him that I was waiting for you to - Okay. You were off the net when they explained the - But don't they - Can't we monitor our CDU's anymore to tell when to switch antennas, so they've just - When they can see it switch - it will take a couple of minutes for them to get up. And they'll always make a voice check with you. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
106827.1;CMP; It came out here. I caught it. Okay. Now, are you getting squared away, I'll give you the comm here.;CAPCOM
106850.1;CMP; Oh. No, no [Garbled].;CAPCOM
106855.1;CMP;They're showing right now 12.3 amps. Their analysis is based on 14 so they're in better - Okay. Headset's yours.;LMP
106931.1;LMP; Okay, Jack. How do you read?;CMP
106936.1;CAPCOM; Hearing you loud and clear, Fred. OMNI.;LMP
106940.1;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
106941.1;CAPCOM; Okay, I heard the ...;LMP
106942.1;LMP; I see you luck out with all the good shifts.;CAPCOM
106946.1;CAPCOM; Yes, I got all the good deals. I heard Jack brief you on the comm mode so, you got any questions about that?;LMP
106959.1;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
106985.1;CAPCOM; And how is your PTC going? I heard Jack tell you that we can't see your CDU's. How's it going?;LMP
106996.1;LMP; Well, let's see, we may be offsetting slightly, the Sun looks like it may be a little higher now. Here comes the Earth by and it looks about the same perspective. I'll have to wait to see the Moon on the other side, Jack. [Garbled];CAPCOM
107016.1;CAPCOM;"Okay, Fred, I can't hear you any more on account of the background noise. I assume that - I think I heard Jack tell you what we're going to do about comm. Uplink Squelch, Off. You'll take care of the antennas because we can't see your attitude. We'll give you a voice check when come up. it'll take us 3 to 5 minutes to come up. And to make it astronaut-proof, when you see the Earth, use a forward antenna; when you see the Moon, use the aft one.";LMP
107047.1;LMP; Yes, that's pretty straightforward. Okay, I see the Earth so I've very wisely shifted to FORWARD.;CAPCOM
107056.1;CAPCOM; Good boy. [Long pause.];LMP
107108.1;LMP; Got another battery?;CAPCOM
107111.1;CMP; [garble] really sick.;LMP
107113.1;LMP; Earth will be by over there in a minute.;CMP
107132.5;LMP; And, Jack, you still up?;CAPCOM
107136.5;CAPCOM; Still here, Fred.;LMP
107140.5;LMP;Okay, when I was upstairs, just a minute ago, I noticed what appeared to be some new ventings from down the Service Module way. I noticed that out window 1, and also saw one chunk of metal - loose metal about 4 inches square that was tumbling around - silver in color, and it looked like it had come from somewhere down in the Service Module.;CAPCOM
107172.5;CAPCOM;Okay. You saw some venting out window 1...;LMP
107173.5;LMP; And I...;CAPCOM
107176.5;CAPCOM; Go ahead.;LMP
107178.5;LMP; Yes, that's where I happened to be looking. The lighting was such that it showed up out there. What reminded me of it was I'm looking out the LM window now and I see a good part of the new star field it's created for us. There are about a thousand little sparklies out here.;CAPCOM
107198.5;CAPCOM;Okay, so you're seeing some venting out window 1, and you saw a 4-inch-square piece of loose metal which was silver, and - Are you still seeing the venting or has it zeroed out now?;LMP
107216.5;LMP; I don't know. I left upstairs, I'm down in the LM now, Jack. I guess when Jack goes up he can take a look and let me know. Okay, I'll think about switching aft here directly. I see the Moon, and the Moon looks pretty good, Jack, so I guess our PTC still going pretty good.;CAPCOM
107237.5;CAPCOM; Okay, and we won't have any comm delay if the PTC stays good. [Long pause.];LMP
107260.5;LMP; Yes, sure enough the Moon is getting smaller.;CAPCOM
107265.5;CAPCOM; Good, and we want to ask you another question about the venting. Is this - would you suppose - some new venting or is this venting that you just hadn't - that's been going on all the time, but which you hadn't looked at recently?;LMP
107284.5;LMP; I can't really say, Jack, we've been so tied up, down in the LM, I guess we kind of forgot about the other half. But I've been upstairs several times and hadn't particularly noticed any flow by the windows before, so I - my first assumption was that it was some new venting. It really wasn't very heavy.;CAPCOM
107311.5;CAPCOM; Okay. Copy. Thank you.;LMP
107313.5;LMP; And Jack's going up to take a look now.;CAPCOM
107315.5;CAPCOM;Okay. And for your information, all of our numbers are based on amperage usage of 14 amps. And we're using only 12.3, so we're a little fat on our analysis.;LMP
107337.5;LMP; Very good. Way to be.;CAPCOM
107340.5;CAPCOM; And we're in a ...;LMP
107341.5;LMP; I'll tell you, this Aquarius has really been a winner.;CAPCOM
107349.5;CAPCOM;Well, that's one of several. And we want to tell you something that I told Jim earlier, and that concerns control. Right now you have control in hardover if you need it, but when we go to some normal control modes, since we have the quad heaters off. We want to have a 15-minute notice for attitude control request. Over.;LMP
107383.5;LMP;Okay, Jack. Offhand, I can't imagine that since we got the platform powered down why we'd need to worry about the instantaneous control. But at any rate, we need 15-minutes warmup with the heaters before we can start using thrusters.;CAPCOM
107402.5;CAPCOM; Right. And another thing we've done is to pull your ECS and EPC DISPLAY breakers and so - But we left your CAUTION and WARNING powered up. So if you get ECS-type or EPS CAUTION and WARNING you'll have to power up those meters with the DISPLAY breakers. And we are watching for you your PIPA temperatures, your ASA TEMP, your propellant temperatures except for the DPS propellant, and we're watching your quad temps for you.;LMP
107439.5;LMP; Okay. That's very good, Jack. You're watching them. That's good enough.;CAPCOM
107449.5;CAPCOM; And everybody's fine at home El Lago. [Pause.];LMP
107458.5;LMP; Great. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
107519.5;CAPCOM;"And, Fred, your CO<sub>2</sub> is building up. It's at 11.3 on our gauge, and we've got a medical buildup to 15 millimeters, at which time we'll switch over to secondary. Looks like we've got plenty of lithium hydroxide, about 192 hours including the CSM cartridges. And as you know, we've got a way to use those. And as soon as we get them written in some good words, why, we'll pass; that along. You might be able to make one.";LMP
107541.5;LMP;Okay. Yes, we'll sure give her a try. And I'm showing onboard about 12-1/2 millimeters of mercury.;CAPCOM
107552.5;CAPCOM; Roger. And I have a Flight Plan update when you get a time to copy it sometime, I'll pass it along. There's no hurry on it.;LMP
107563.5;LMP;Okay. Stand by 1. Jack's back now. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
107576.5;LMP;"Okay. Jack just came back and he said it's still coming out; it's coming out only on the commander's side. So he saw it out the same window I did, window 1. And it's between the minus Y and minus Z axis.";CAPCOM
107595.5;CAPCOM; Okay. And of course ...;LMP
107596.5;LMP; Jack says it's definitely the Service Module which was - which was my impression, too.;CAPCOM
107602.5;CAPCOM; Okay. So you're sure it's the Service Module, and, of course, the thing we're interested in knowing, is it something that is residual from before, or is it something new. And if you have any ideas about that, why we'd sure like to have them. [Pause.];LMP
107629.5;LMP; Yes. Yes, Jack, I'll answer him your question in a minute, but make Jack's first impression here, is that it's not near the intensity that it was right after our mishap. And I'll have to agree with that. I'd say - he said it was a half and I said it was maybe down to a third. And Houston would like to know if you have any impressions as to whether it is still a residual from that or maybe something new. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
107673.5;LMP; I don't know why after I felt that. Yes, I felt it was some new something - new venting, too. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
107714.5;LMP; Okay. Switch to Forward Omni.;CAPCOM
107719.5;CAPCOM; Freddo, if you think it's practical, we're ready to give you some - we're working on some camera settings for pictures of the venting. And, if you have a camera out and ready to go, let us know which one it is so we can get the settings for that camera. What do you think about that.;LMP
107738.5;LMP;Okay. Jack's got the one with the 250-millimeters lens on it. That's the standard EL. And I have a surface camera out that I've been shooting hundreds of Earth/Moon pictures with, camera 1. And we also have the Reseau upstairs that's pretty handy. The Command Module DC camera. So you can about ...;CAPCOM
107768.5;CAPCOM; Okay. I copy that...;LMP
107769.5;LMP; ...take your choice, because...;CAPCOM
107772.5;CAPCOM;I copy the 250 millimeter, the Reseau is available, but I didn't get what other one is.;LMP
107782.5;LMP;Okay. I got my Hasselblad surface camera down in the LM here handy, too, camera 1.;CAPCOM
107892.5;LMP; And, Jack, if we're going to do any picture taking out the Command Module windows, I think we'd better do that pretty quick, or hold up until Jim and Jack get their rest done.;CAPCOM
107909.5;CAPCOM; We concur with that. [Long pause.];LMP
107971.5;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred, we're not going to bother the skipper up there. We won't be taking any pictures out of the Command Module window until after rest period.;LMP
107982.5;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
108024.5;LMP; Shifting to Forward Omni. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
108069.5;CAPCOM;Okay. Fred, for your information, your CO<sub>2</sub> reading onboard is a little higher than what we're reading here on the ground, and so when it gets to 15 on your meter, switch to secondary. And we'd like to get a status about every 30 minutes - we'll give you a call on that. But just to let us know we're still thinking about you, we'd like you to go Biomed Right, please.;LMP
108099.5;LMP; Okay. Going Biomed Right.;CAPCOM
108202.5;LMP; How, how do you read me on this comm mode on S-band?;CAPCOM
108208.5;CAPCOM;5 square, Fred. How me?;LMP
108253.7;CAPCOM; We're still here, Fred. How's it going?;LMP
108261.7;LMP;Okay. My CO<sub>2</sub> reading is now just below 13.;CAPCOM
108271.7;CAPCOM; Say again what it is.;LMP
108275.7;LMP;It's just - just below 13.;CAPCOM
108279.7;CAPCOM;Okay. Just below 13. And just for your information, we've got people working on several subjects. We're working on the midcourse coming up to determine our control system and how to do it with the control system we select, what we should do about the alignment. We've got the LMS and a couple of crews cranked up working on that. And we're also working on our entry, how and when we ought to activate the CSM. And we're working on the CSM systems status. Tomorrow sometime we're going to have a Main Bus B checkout, so we've got a lot of people swinging pretty hard here and I've got some f-stop settings for you for the lunar surface camera. At 1/250th, we'd like you to take targets of opportunity. Each picture use three f-stops, because we don't know exactly which one is going to work the best, so use 4, 5.6, and 8 and 1/250th for the surface camera. Copy? [Pause.];LMP
108362.7;LMP;Okay. Use the surface camera at 1/250th, 4, 5.6, and 8. And I've been doing quite a bit of shooting at covering two of those numbers in the range 5.6, and 8. I've also been shooting some at 11, so I'll just drop it down a little more. The Moon is still so big and bright there that I got a feeling that the Moon is probably up around the f/8 to f/11 range.;CAPCOM
108396.7;CAPCOM; Roger, I didn't catch that last part. Maybe when the comm gets a little better you can say it again. [Pause.];LMP
108413.7;LMP; Okay. How do you read now, Jack?;CAPCOM
108415.7;CAPCOM; That's a lot better, Fred.;LMP
108418.7;LMP;"Okay, I just said the Moon is still so bright, that I think probably the higher range of f-stops will be better; f/8, maybe even f/11.";CAPCOM
108432.7;CAPCOM; Okay. [Pause.];LMP
108441.7;LMP; I can just barely, on the left corner of the Moon now, make out the foothills of Fra Mauro formation. We never did get to see it when we were in close, there. [Pause.];CAPCOM
108463.7;CAPCOM;Okay. I'm reading on my monitor here, Fred, that you're 16,214 miles away from the Moon moving at about 4,500 feet per second. [Pause.];LMP
108486.7;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
108511.7;LMP; From the sounds of all the work that is going on and is still going on, this flight is probably a lot bigger test for the system on the ground than up here.;CAPCOM
108531.7;CAPCOM; Yes, you've been - you've been working it out a little bit. [Pause.];LMP
108545.7;LMP; Yes. I've really got a tough job right now switching Omnis. [Pause.];CAPCOM
108558.7;CAPCOM;Well, everybody down here is 100-per-cent optimistic. Looks like we're on the up side of the whole thing now. [Pause.];LMP
108571.7;LMP; Yes, I guess we had better be in good shape, particularly ourselves, rested for that entry day. I think that is going to be a pretty busy one.;CAPCOM
108583.7;CAPCOM; Right, and we're working on procedures for that. Ken's been doing quite a bit of work on getting ready for entry.;LMP
108597.7;LMP; Very good.;CAPCOM
108610.9;CAPCOM; How's it going Fred?;LMP
108616.9;LMP; Okay. Just fine.;CAPCOM
108618.9;CAPCOM;Okay. We're considering a midcourse correction at 104 hours - about 20 hours from now - 18 hours from now, and it's only 7 feet per second. The other option is to keep PTC up, since we may not be able to get back into it again, and delay it. So, that's the type of thing we're thinking about, but - just wanted to let you know that you're pretty much right in the middle of the fairway there and our present tracking, with no midcourse has you - with a Gamma of 7.11, as opposed to 6.51. So, you're already in the corridor. You're just a half a degree between the center and the outer limits and we're going to tweak that up.;LMP
108673.9;LMP; Okay. That sounds good.;CAPCOM
108678.9;CAPCOM;And - we don't - Well, we think there might have been a misunderstanding earlier on the potable water. Don't worry about drinking water. Drink all you want. There's plenty of it. There's 38 pounds, and the Surgeon recommends that you use some of the fruit juices as well. Over.;LMP
108701.9;LMP;Okay. Yes, we went up and - and used the procedure to pressurize surge tank, and Jack and I made up a total of 22 drinks of - drinking water.;CAPCOM
108720.9;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];LMP
108737.9;CAPCOM; And I assume that Jack is up there sleeping now too, right?;LMP
108744.9;LMP; Yes. That's affirm. They're both up there. [Pause.];CAPCOM
108758.9;LMP; I hate to say it, Jack, but I think our PTC is about to wobble off a little bit. I've noticed that the Earth is coming by somewhat lower in the window and the Moon is going by somewhat higher.;CAPCOM
108777.9;CAPCOM; Okay. Understand. PTC, Earth is coming by lower and Moon is coming by higher.;LMP
108787.9;LMP; Yes.;CAPCOM
108896.9;CAPCOM; And, Fred, on this jerry-rigged Command Module lithium hydroxide canister, what we're going to do is we're going to have to make at least two up and use two at a time - one on each set of hoses. What we'll do is we'll connect one of these jerry-rigged boxes to the red fittings and air will be sucked through the lithium hydroxide and then blown out the blue fitting. And we're also going to, when we do this, remove the LM lithium hydroxide canister from the suit loop, either the primary or the secondary, and we're getting the words together to make it easy to build one of these things, and it looks like it will probably take two guys, so, I think we probably ought to plan to do that later. In addition, we have to go up and get a couple of canisters out of the Command Module, so it looks like maybe a smart idea would be to delay a little bit and have you build a couple of these later on. What do you think?;LMP
108975.9;LMP; Yes. I agree Jack. Jack Swigert and I went upstairs earlier and both got a canister, and we were scratching around for some material and thinking about using them, and that's actually why - when we made up all the water to drink because we needed the plastic container that they were housed in in the pantry, and we had that ready to use with some material plus some of the - the extra porous bags that were going to be used for the dump control that we may just cut up and use, too.;CAPCOM
109012.9;CAPCOM; Did you come up with a design or ...;LMP
109014.9;LMP; Plus we got lots...;CAPCOM
109018.9;LMP; No. We just thought we'd see what we had in the way of material and stand by for your word. Of course, we also have lots of stiff-backed cardboard flight data.;CAPCOM
109033.9;CAPCOM; Yes. We have decided to use a canister and, you know that the liquid-cooled garment has a bag around it that we think we can use, too, or that we know we can use. We've tried it. So what you have is the - a bag within a bag and inside that is the liquid-cooled garment. The bag that is closest to the liquid-cooled garment is the one we need, and we've got two of them. And then, of course, we've got to use some tape and, as you say, one of the backs to flight data file time line book or something like that, and, just using those materials, we can make this jerry-rigged canister. So, the bag that we're looking for is the one that is right next to the liquid cooled garment, and, if we're very careful about where we cut it, we can make a pretty good rig.;LMP
109106.9;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
109109.9;CAPCOM; It looks like we'll have to use that bag over again, though, because we only got two of them, and I expect that we'll have to make more than two of these canisters up.;LMP
109122.9;LMP; Roger. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
109173.9;CAPCOM;Fred, in about 4 minutes, we're going to hand you over to a different communications site, and it's going to take us about a minute or so to reestablish uplink, so you can be prepared for that.;LMP
109189.9;LMP; Okay, Jack.;CAPCOM
109221.1;CAPCOM; Freddo, we've handed over now. How do you read?;LMP
109227.1;LMP; Loud and clear, Jack.;CAPCOM
109229.1;CAPCOM; Same here.;LMP
109237.1;LMP; In fact, you're coming in a little louder.;CAPCOM
109244.1;CAPCOM; Fred, you'll have to say again. Can't read you there. There's too much background noise. Maybe we need a new antenna.;LMP
109255.1;LMP; Okay. I'm on the other OMNI now. I just said that you're coming in even louder than previously.;CAPCOM
109265.1;CAPCOM; Roger. Maybe it's because I'm standing up. You're coming in better now, too.;LMP
109272.7;LMP; And, for your information, Jack, I'm just going to tear into some beef and gravy and other assorted goodies.;CAPCOM
109287.7;CAPCOM; I presume that you're doing this with the full permission and - of the commander. [Pause.];LMP
109305.7;LMP; And this - at this moment, who do you think is the commander? [Pause.];CAPCOM
109317.7;CAPCOM; If I was him, I'd make you sign out everything you ate, so I'd know. [Long pause.];LMP
109342.7;LMP; Well, I'm sneaking inside of the LM where he doesn't have [garble] Incidentally, this PTC must have some - must have a wobble mode around our X-axis there because now the Moon and Earth are back in the right perspective.;CAPCOM
109364.7;CAPCOM; Good. Let's see if it goes the other way. [Long pause.];LMP
109386.7;CAPCOM; These guys down here are saying they knew it all the time. [Long pause.];LMP
109402.7;LMP;Well, that's right. They do good work. Whoever heard of doing a P52 in the LM?;CAPCOM
109514.7;CAPCOM;Say, Fred, sometime when you're not too busy chewing on that beef, how about telling us what the CO<sub>2</sub> reads? [Pause.];LMP
109529.7;LMP;Okay, I'm reading 13, 1 3.;CAPCOM
109533.7;CAPCOM; Okay. It looks like our reading is getting kind of close to yours.;LMP
109567.5;LMP; Yes. It appears the wobble is going the other way, Jack, because the Earth is now rising and the Moon is starting to get lower in the window.;CAPCOM
109580.5;CAPCOM; Roger. Could you give us an LPD number periodically?;LMP
109590.5;LMP; LPD number? Yes, okay.;CAPCOM
109597.5;CAPCOM; In fact, if you could give it two or three REVs in a row, why then we could predict where it's going and maybe help us set it up again if we have to.;LMP
109610.5;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
109624.5;LMP;Okay. The center of the Earth has just gone by at an LPD number of 4.;CAPCOM
109630.5;CAPCOM;Roger. LPD 4, center of the Earth.;LMP
109640.5;LMP;And the center of the Moon is about LPD 21.;CAPCOM
109645.5;CAPCOM;Okay. LPD 21. Is that the center of the Moon, you say?;LMP
109652.5;LMP; That's affirm.;CAPCOM
109753.5;CAPCOM;"And, Fred, we're doing a little better on our water than we had anticipated. Our numbers were designed for 3.5 pounds per hour; we're using about 3.0, and expect to go a little bit less.";LMP
109772.5;LMP; Beautiful. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
109793.5;LMP; When this flight's all over, we'll really be able to figure out what a LM can do. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
109823.5;CAPCOM; Maybe it'll make the some more.;LMP
109830.5;LMP; If it had a heat shield, I'd say bring it home.;CAPCOM
109866.1;LMP;Okay. The Earth went - just went by about - clear above the LPD index. It was - it was, if it were extended, the number would be minus 6.;CAPCOM
109882.1;CAPCOM;Okay. Way up there at minus 6.;LMP
109889.1;LMP; Yes, there's actually no such number. I just extended the line beyond zero which, for a negative rate, is what it would be if there was one.;CAPCOM
109901.1;CAPCOM;Right. Understand. If minus 6 was there, that's where it would be. Right?;LMP
109910.1;LMP; That's right. [Pause.];CAPCOM
109921.1;CAPCOM; Do you still have that super-dense star field? [Pause.];LMP
109933.1;LMP; It's still there. I'm looking at it right now. I can look at - the Sun is right behind me, then all these sparklies show up. Yes. It kind of looks like I'm right in the middle of the - of the Milky Way. There are several thousand little sparklies at various ranges out as far as I can see [Garbled]. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
109986.1;LMP; They're kind of interesting. They're all moving [garble] and sparkling there. And I can [garble] - at least I think I can what will occasionally give you a real star from the bunch of sparklies, but it really does break up the capability to pick out a star pattern, particularly through [Garbled].;CAPCOM
110020.1;CAPCOM; Okay. So far, we haven't identified what the sparklies are and what is venting. [Pause.];LMP
110040.1;LMP; Yes, I got a [garble] feeling that we probably won't get any [garble] until we power up.;CAPCOM
110066.1;CAPCOM; How you feeling, Fred? [Pause.];LMP
110074.1;LMP; Oh, as soon as I chug down this grape drink and grapefruit - orange drink, I think I'll be in pretty good shape. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
110096.1;CAPCOM; How much sleep did you get between the burn and the time you got up for this exercise?;LMP
110108.1;LMP;Oh, I'd guesstimate about 4 hours, Jack. Wait a minute, which burn you talking about?;CAPCOM
110121.1;CAPCOM; It was the burn we just made. Did you get any sleep between it, and the time you got up for this watch?;LMP
110130.1;LMP;Oh, no. I didn't - I haven't been to bed since all the action the night before, and I went to go to bed for about 4 hours then [Garbled].;CAPCOM
110140.1;CAPCOM; Yes. [Long pause.];LMP
110156.1;CAPCOM; Well, we're just trying to figure out who's likely to be the most tired up there. You or Jim. [Pause.];LMP
110173.1;LMP; I think we'll get caught up pretty good in the next couple of days.;CAPCOM
110178.1;CAPCOM; Say again.;LMP
110182.1;LMP; We ought to get caught up pretty good in the next couple of days.;CAPCOM
110192.5;LMP;Okay, Jack. The Earth has started back down. The hack on the LPD there was 1 degree.;CAPCOM
110202.5;CAPCOM; Okay. One degree on the center of the Earth.;LMP
110211.8;CAPCOM; That was a good TV show you put on the other night, Fred, during LM entry. [Pause.];LMP
110224.8;LMP;Yes. It would have been an even better one about 10 minutes later. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
110248.8;CAPCOM; Yes. Things sure turned to worms there in a hurry after that show. [Long pause.];LMP
110270.8;LMP; Yes. You're right. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
110286.8;LMP;Okay. The center of the Moon now is about minus 2 degrees DELTA-V.;CAPCOM
110293.8;CAPCOM;Minus 2 degrees, center of the Moon.;LMP
110362.8;CAPCOM; Charlie said to say hello. [Pause.];LMP
110369.8;LMP; Who's that?;CAPCOM
110371.8;CAPCOM; Charlie.;LMP
110376.8;LMP; Is he still around there? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
110394.8;LMP;Unless my watch is wrong, it says it's almost 2 a.m. back there.;CAPCOM
110400.8;CAPCOM; No. That's the bearded one. [Pause.];LMP
110407.8;LMP; Oh! Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
110453.8;LMP; Hey, tell Charlie that I'll be back down there personally to thank him for this baby.;CAPCOM
110466.8;CAPCOM; Sure will. I did.;LMP
110484.8;LMP;Okay. The Earth went by there, Jack, at LPD about 18 degrees.;CAPCOM
110491.8;CAPCOM;Roger. We copy 18 degrees for the center of the Earth.;LMP
110510.0;LMP;Okay. The Moon - I'd estimate it up around minus - somewhere 17 to minus 20 degrees LPD.;CAPCOM
110521.0;CAPCOM;Okay. Moon's minus 17 to minus 20.;LMP
110588.0;CAPCOM; How would you like to spend a week on an aircraft carrier getting back? [Pause.];LMP
110602.0;LMP; If I can get on an aircraft carrier, I don't care how long it takes, Jack. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
110662.0;CAPCOM;They're going to take you by helo to Samoa. You'll spend the night in Samoa, get on a 141, and be at Ellington shortly thereafter. [Pause.];LMP
110680.0;LMP; Okay. Kind of sounds like the original plans for the [garble] [Long pause.];CAPCOM
110718.0;CAPCOM; Had you worrying that you're going to spend the night on the ship, helo to Samoa and directly to Ellington.;LMP
110729.0;LMP; Very good. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
110781.0;LMP; Boy, these thrusters are sure [Garbled];CAPCOM
110789.0;CAPCOM; Fred, I'm not reading you. Maybe we'd better wait until we change antennas or unless you can speak up a little louder.;LMP
110797.0;LMP; How do you read now?;CAPCOM
110799.0;CAPCOM; Better.;LMP
110803.0;LMP; Okay. The thrusters [garble] and the [garble] outside [garble] and they hardly look like they [Garbled];CAPCOM
110826.0;CAPCOM; Gee, I'm sorry, Fred. We're just not reading you right now. Maybe we'll have to wait a little bit.;LMP
110834.0;LMP; Okay. [Pause.];CAPCOM
110843.0;CAPCOM; Let's try it now. If you can speak up, the background noise has gone down a little bit.;LMP
110851.0;LMP; Okay. How do you read now?;CAPCOM
110853.0;CAPCOM; A little better.;LMP
110858.0;LMP;I was just commenting - I've been looking here at the thrusters on quads 1 and 4. We've got a slight discoloration on the outside of the barrel. The nozzles look like they hadn't ever been fired, - like they're brand new. [garble] of like those skinny things on the interior on the upper nozzle [garble] [Pause.];CAPCOM
110888.0;CAPCOM;You say the coloration of the thrusters appears they haven't been fired on quads 1 and 4?;LMP
110898.0;LMP;I'm saying all of them look clean again. I guess they've fired so clean that they don't seem to [garble] at all. [garble] different color, [garble] copper, bronze, color of the oxygen cell. They've been fired because I watched them fire. Okay. The Earth's going by at an LPD of 42.;CAPCOM
110932.0;CAPCOM;Roger. Copy LPD 42. Is that affirm?;LMP
110937.0;LMP; That's affirm. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
110951.0;CAPCOM; And, Fred, that may be why the comm is a little bit degraded, more background noise, because we're getting out of attitude a little bit there.;LMP
110962.0;LMP; Roger.;CAPCOM
110976.8;LMP; How do you read on AFT Omni now [Garbled]?;CAPCOM
110981.8;CAPCOM; I'm reading you, Fred. I've got a lot of background noise. Looks like it might come and go with attitude.;LMP
110992.8;LMP; Yes. I think that's probably - just looking through the Command Module at you now. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
111043.8;LMP; How do you read now, Jack?;CAPCOM
111045.8;CAPCOM; About the same, Fred.;LMP
111050.8;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
111066.8;LMP;Okay. And the Moon just went by at about minus 14 degrees.;CAPCOM
111071.8;CAPCOM;Okay, the Moon at minus 14. [Pause.];LMP
111082.8;LMP; That - that's correct.;CAPCOM
111086.8;CAPCOM;Okay. Your landing in - your weather in the landing area, which is about 560 miles south of Samoa, is now predicted to be about 1500, scattered, high broken. Waves are going to be 5 feet, the winds are going to be 15 knots, visibility 10 miles, showers in less than 10 percent of the area, and you will be landing at 08:00 local, roughly.;LMP
111122.8;LMP; Hey, that all sounds pretty good.;CAPCOM
111137.2;CAPCOM; Say, Fred, did you get the dope on the Saturn IV impact - S-IVB impact?;LMP
111149.2;LMP; Yes. Just as we came around the corner, Vance told us that it hit - I don't recall the position now, but it was a [garble] impact [garble] and recorded it on the [garble] seismometer. [Pause.];CAPCOM
111172.2;CAPCOM;Yes. It impacted 74 nautical miles from the ALSEP and the passive seismic detected major seismic activity on all long period channels and this was - this activity was detected for 4 hours afterwards with decreasing amplitude. And the impact also was detected by the high-energy channels [garble] The high-energy channels of the SIDE. [Long pause.];LMP
111226.2;LMP; Yes. That ought to add [garble].;CAPCOM
111330.2;LMP;Okay. The Earth LPD number that time was 32.;CAPCOM
111336.2;CAPCOM; Roger. Thirty-two.;LMP
111376.0;LMP; How do you read now, Jack?;CAPCOM
111381.0;CAPCOM; I'm reading you, Fred. I've got a lot of background noise, though.;LMP
111387.0;LMP; Jack, I can definitely tell we're moving away from the Moon, now. I got it all in the monocular at one time. We're right over the top of Messier A right now.;CAPCOM
111402.0;CAPCOM; You're right over the top of what?;LMP
111403.0;LMP; On a point between it and Censorinus - Messier A and - the point halfway between there and Censorinus. [Pause.];CAPCOM
111425.0;CAPCOM; Freddo, would say the checkpoint over which you're right now?;LMP
111435.0;LMP; Okay. And incidentally, the LPD on the Moon was zero, so it's coming back down. The point looks like we're just about straight over is around Censorinus and the point between it and Messier A.;CAPCOM
111458.0;CAPCOM; Okay.;LMP
111472.2;LMP;Okay. And, Jack, the Earth LPD angle is 24 degrees.;CAPCOM
111479.2;CAPCOM;Roger. Earth at 24. And it looks like you're getting up to about 15 on the CO<sub>2</sub>, so we want you to select Secondary and swap out the primary cartridge. Over.;LMP
111495.2;LMP; Okay. I'll select Secondary and swap out the primary cartridge. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
111518.2;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. And when you select - When you swap out the primary cartridge, don't reselect Primary. Stay on Secondary until we use the secondary up. Over.;LMP
111535.2;LMP; Okay. I'm changing out primary and - stay in Secondary until we use it up.;CAPCOM
111550.6;LMP; And the change out is complete, Jack.;CAPCOM
111557.6;CAPCOM;Okay. Copy the changeout complete, and we're reading 4.5 on the CO<sub>2</sub> here.;LMP
111568.6;LMP; Okay. I'm [garble].;CAPCOM
111583.3;LMP;Okay. And the Earth LPD was 8 degrees.;CAPCOM
111587.3;CAPCOM;Did you - Did you say 8 degrees, Fred?;LMP
111593.3;LMP; Affirmative.;CAPCOM
111596.3;CAPCOM; Okay.;LMP
111604.0;LMP;Well, I missed the Moon on that one, Jack. But I would guess - estimating back a little bit, the LPD angle was somewhere around 42.;CAPCOM
111615.0;CAPCOM; Fred, I'm having a hard time reading you, but I think you're giving me an LPD angle.;LMP
111624.0;LMP;Roger. That's it s Jack. The Moon is about 42.;CAPCOM
111628.0;CAPCOM;You say the Moon is at 22?;LMP
111635.0;LMP;Four two, 42.;CAPCOM
111636.0;CAPCOM;Okay, 4 2. Thank you.;LMP
111642.4;CAPCOM; How you doing there, Fred?;CDR
111648.4;CDR; [unintelligible] [Long pause.];CAPCOM
111666.4;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. I can just barely hear you saying something in the background and I can't make out what it is.;CDR
111677.4;CDR;" Hello, Houston; Aquarius.";CAPCOM
111681.4;CAPCOM; Hello there, Aquarius. Go ahead.;CDR
111686.4;CDR; Roger. And Fred is being relieved now. He's - went back to get some rest. This is Lovell here who's got the duty.;CAPCOM
111696.4;CAPCOM; Gee whiz. You got up kind of early, didn't you?;CDR
111703.4;CDR; It's cold back there in the Command Module. [Pause.];CAPCOM
111713.4;CAPCOM; Well, what we were really thinking about doing was letting you sleep a little bit longer because we figure you're pretty worn out. [Pause.];CDR
111730.4;CDR; Well, I'll go back and forth once in a while to get a [garble];CAPCOM
111736.4;CAPCOM; Is Jack up there with you?;CDR
111743.4;CDR; No, Jack's still sacked out. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
111776.4;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. We're kind of watching this PTC a little bit. Fred's been giving us a few LPD angles as we swang by the center of the Earth - center of the Moon. We noticed that the comm has been degrading just a little bit so you might have to talk up. [Pause.];CDR
111804.4;CDR; Roger. Understand.;CAPCOM
111806.4;CAPCOM;And we just went on to the secondary CO<sub>2</sub> canister. Fred swapped out the primary, but we want to stay on the secondary until it is all used up. [Pause.];CDR
111825.4;CDR;Okay. I'm going to use the tape [garble] partial pressure CO<sub>2</sub>.;CAPCOM
111837.4;CAPCOM;We're reading a partial pressure CO<sub>2</sub> of 4.2 millimeters. We're cleared to use the secondary until it reaches 15.;CDR
111852.4;CDR; Okay. That's good.;CAPCOM
111867.6;CAPCOM; Aquarius, in comparing our initial estimates of water usage and electrical power usage, it appears that we're right on the money on water usage, and we're using a little less amperes than we had originally expected in our first analysis, so we're either right on the money or just a little bit ahead of the game in that regard.;CDR
111898.6;CDR; Well, that sounds encouraging, Jack.;CAPCOM
111904.6;CAPCOM; And there are a few temperatures that we're watching for you. You have the heaters powered down. We're looking at them, and those include the PIPAs, the ASA, the quad temps, and your propellants, except for the DPS propellant.;CDR
111929.6;CDR; Okay. I've got them here. [Pause.];CAPCOM
111942.6;CAPCOM; We have, as you probably know, several groups working on procedures from here on out. We have a group working on midcourse corrections to determine a system, the attitudes, how to do it, alignment techniques, and so forth. We have a group working on the entry, including how and when we're going to activate the CSM. We have a group working on the CSM system status, and in a few hours - Later on tomorrow, from where we see it, we're going to go to some base configuration on the CSM and we're going to conduct a MAIN BUS B check. Right now the comm is kind of degrading, and I can't hear what you're about to say very well. But I just want to keep you advised as to how things are going here. And remember you've got duty on the antennas. [Long pause.];CDR
112060.6;CAPCOM; Aquarius, are you reading Houston?;CDR
112064.6;CDR; [Garbled];CAPCOM
112070.6;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. I can hear you talking but I can't tell what you're saying because you're way down in the background noise.;CDR
112080.6;CDR; Okay. Can you hear Aquarius now? Over.;CAPCOM
112083.6;CAPCOM; Oh, yes. That's much better. Did you get my report on the various types of people and what they're doing around here?;CDR
112090.6;CDR; Roger. Sounds like you had things well organized. You might also consider what kind of a stowage configuration [garble] and what we can leave behind in Aquarius. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
112110.6;CAPCOM;" Okay, Jim. I didn't catch that suggestion on account of the background noise; may be we can pass it on when it gets more favorable.";CDR
112127.6;CDR; I'm thinking in terms of stowage. Whether we would leave the suit, [garble] the Hycon camera in Aquarius, prior to [garble] [Pause.];CAPCOM
112146.6;CAPCOM; Okay. I heard you say something about using the Hycon camera in Aquarius.;CDR
112156.6;CDR;" Negative, Jack. I'm thinking of reentry stowage attitude. Whether we should - what we should leave behind in Aquarius. Leave the suits behind; leaving such big items as the Hycon cameras in Aquarius. Over.";CAPCOM
112173.6;CAPCOM; Oh, understand. You're thinking about stowage. What'll we leave behind in Aquarius when we fall back into Odyssey. Is that right?;CDR
112184.6;CDR; That's affirmative.;CAPCOM
112186.6;CAPCOM; Okay. We've people working on that, too. [Long pause.];CDR
112206.6;CAPCOM;And we presently are tracking you at 22,500 [nautical] miles [41,670 km] from the Moon, moving out at 4,400 feet a second [1,340 m/s]. [Pause.];CDR
112223.6;CDR; Aquarius. Roger.;CAPCOM
112237.0;CAPCOM;And, Jim, earlier in the evening, we thought there was a misunderstanding about the amount of potable water you can drink, but we want to advise you that you can drink as much water as you want to. There's 38 pounds in the potable tank, and that's about all you'll need. The doctors suggest you drink as much fruit juices as you want, too.;CDR
112263.0;CDR; Roger, Jack.;CAPCOM
112278.7;CAPCOM;Jim, earlier in the evening, Freddo reported some venting out of window number 1 in the Command Module. He also reported a piece of loose metal about 4 inches square, silver, floating by, and one thing we were trying to establish is whether or not this is a new venting or whether this is part of the residual venting of our original problem. Do you have any more words or comments? And one thing he was doing was taking some photographs and we authorized photographs, targets of opportunity, using the lunar-surface camera number 1, and use the setting of 1/250 of a second, and not knowing precisely what f-stop to use, we suggested taking three of each, using settings of f:4, f:5.6, and f:8. Over. [Pause.];CDR
112343.7;CDR; Roger, Jack. The venting really seems to [garble] I reported earlier, I also spotted the large piece go by and prior to our [garble] burn [garble] The venting you see now is much greater [garble] went into the dark mode, you could easily distinguish stars and didn't have the bright articles and bright objects, and I also have the camera here to take photographs [Garbled];CAPCOM
112415.7;CAPCOM;" Okay, Jim. Once again I hear you talking back there but I can only pick out a few words; maybe we'll have a better time. [Long pause.]";CDR
112460.7;CAPCOM; Aquarius, we're trying to improve our communications. Could you turn the BIOMED off and give us a voice check, please? [Pause.];CDR
112475.7;CDR;"Voice check follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; voice check out.";CAPCOM
112484.7;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. That seemed to be better.;CDR
112525.9;CAPCOM; How are you doing there, Aquarius?;CDR
112531.9;CDR; We're doing good, Jack.;CAPCOM
112533.9;CAPCOM; Okay. Sometime when you get two guys available there and you could construct one of these lithium hydroxide rigs, I'd like to have you get the materials together, and we'll go through the steps together.;CDR
112551.9;CDR; Okay. Sounds good. And how do you read me now?;CAPCOM
112556.9;CAPCOM; Well, there is a lot of background noise, and sometimes it is worse than others and right now I hear you better than I have in the past.;CDR
112568.9;CDR; Okay, Jack. I'm kind of curious the amount of perturbations our PTC attitude is taking. I notice that we are getting off attitude, and I'm just kind of curious how far we can let this go. [Pause.];CAPCOM
112586.9;CAPCOM; We were tracking the attitudes with Fred earlier and it looked like what we were doing was oscillating about some point, but coming back. Are you detecting some kind of divergence now?;CDR
112604.9;CDR; Not too much. I notice that it's different than when I went to sleep. We are more at an angle now with the terminator of the Earth, so when we started out, we were just about parallel with the terminator, and now we are canted off somewhat. I haven't seen any trends, though, of going back and forth. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
112651.9;CAPCOM; And, Jim, our current plan is to not correct the PTC. We're going to take whatever we get and live with it. And we can kind of keep track of what's going on a little better if when you swing past the Earth and swing past the center of the Moon, if you could read off the LPD angles for the center of the Earth and the center of the Moon. Over. [Pause.];CDR
112677.9;CDR;"Roger. Will do, Jack. And I'm looking into the AOT now to the right - No, the number 4 detent, and we are venting something back there; I can see particles moving on past the Command Module. What it is, I don't know.";CAPCOM
112702.9;CAPCOM; Okay. Can you identify the quadrant? [Long pause.];CDR
112721.9;CDR;Well, I'm looking through the right rear reticle now of the AOT, and when I was back in the Command Module, I could see it out of the CM 1 window. The particles are rather small, but they are coming out with some force. That's probably what is disturbing our PTC attitude.;CAPCOM
112753.9;CAPCOM; Yes, that sounds quite probable, Jim. That's about the same report we got from Fred, but we haven't been able to identify what they might be and probably won't be able to until we crank up the CSM. If there's any change in that status, why, we just want to keep advised of it.;CDR
112774.9;CDR; Roger. Understand. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
112832.9;CAPCOM;And, Aquarius, we are setting a pretty good vector on you now. And it looks like you're a little bit outside of the corridor. We're looking at a 7 foot per second midcourse at 104 hours. We are going to come up with an Entry Interface minus 8 pad to use in the event of a loss of comm situation [Pause.];CDR
112862.9;CDR; Roger. Understand, and I hope you have that procedure for attitude.;CAPCOM
112871.9;CAPCOM;We are ginning up a procedure for attitude for you, Jim. For the no-comm case, it may be a little different than what the guys working on the procedures come up with for the burn at 104 hours.;CDR
112892.9;CDR; Roger. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
112919.9;CAPCOM; What I'm saying, Jim, is the guys who are working on this attitude situation for the burns haven't made their final conclusions yet, but in the interim period, we want to come up with something you can use, in the event that you lose comm.;CDR
112936.9;CDR; I concur.;CAPCOM
112957.7;CDR;Houston, Aquarius. The Earth is going through the 10-degree line or angle of the LPD.;CAPCOM
112965.7;CAPCOM;Okay, We copied 10 degrees. Is that Earth or Moon, Jim?;CDR
112971.7;CDR; That is Earth.;CAPCOM
112973.7;CAPCOM;Okay. Earth 10 degrees. Thank you.;CDR
112984.5;CDR;And, Houston [garble] As we [garble] No! [garble] has an angle of about 24 degrees on the LPD.;CAPCOM
112994.5;CAPCOM;Okay. We read 24, Jim.;CDR
113000.5;CDR; That's affirm.;CAPCOM
113007.5;CDR;Jack, [garble] the LPD on the Moon now is 22 degrees.;CAPCOM
113012.5;CAPCOM; Okay. I'm reading you better, Jim. Say again, please.;CDR
113018.5;CDR;Roger. The LPD now on the Moon is 22 degrees. I missed the Earth last time. I'll get it this time.;CAPCOM
113025.5;CAPCOM; Okay. Twenty-two degrees, and looks like we've come up with a procedure for the attitude control on the upcoming burns. Probably the ones that we'll use from here on out. [Pause.];CDR
113044.5;CDR;Okay, Jack. Stand by 1.;CAPCOM
113051.5;CAPCOM; It's going to be a few minutes before I'm ready to read it up to you.;CDR
113059.5;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
113068.9;CDR;Jack, on the Earth of the LPD angles is about a minus 2 degrees and just slightly above the top line.;CAPCOM
113081.9;CAPCOM;Okay. Just went by minus 2 degrees. Is that on the Earth?;CDR
113088.9;CDR; That's the Earth. Now, I don't know whether we're oscillating back and forth or not, Jack, or whether it's a continual motion. We'll have to see here.;CAPCOM
113097.9;CAPCOM; Roger.;CDR
113107.2;CDR;Okay, Jack. The Moon now has an LPD angle of 10 degrees.;CAPCOM
113133.2;CAPCOM;Roger. The Moon at 10 degrees.;CDR
113216.2;CAPCOM;" Okay, Jim. Just as kind of a lead-in to this procedure that we're going to use for the midcourse burn, I'd like to say that we're going to use AGS and it's going to be a manual burn. The attitude will be controlled manually; the start/stop on the engine will be controlled manually. So we have a pretty good vector on you now, and it turns out you're coming in a little bit too shallow. So what that means is we're going to make our burn to come in a little more steeply, and we're going to be coming in around the dark side of the Earth. Therefore, to come in more steep, our thrust should be in the direction of the Sun. Does that all make sense to you?";CDR
113281.2;CDR; I think so. We're going to use AGS for a burn monitor. The burns are going to be manual, and they're going to be started manually and stopped manually.;CAPCOM
113292.2;CAPCOM; Okay. And your reentry is around the dark side of the Earth, and since we're coming in shallow, we're going to have to burn toward the Sun to make it steeper. Do you follow that?;CDR
113317.2;CDR; That's affirm. Especially these burns will be perpendicular to our flight path and to the Sun giving a steeper entry angle. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
113340.2;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. I heard you say perpendicular to your flight path, which is affirmative, and I didn't get the rest of your statement. [Pause.];CDR
113358.2;CDR; I understand the technique, Jack. We're burning to the Sun to steepen our entry angle, and it will be perpendicular to our flight path for corridor control.;CAPCOM
113373.2;CAPCOM; Okay. That's affirmative. So, in general terms, what we're going to have to do is to power up the AGS and bring up the AGS eight-ball, and then to set up your attitude, put the COAS in the front window, and guidance control will be in AGS, of course. But manually orient the spacecraft to place the center of the Earth directly out the Z-axis. Then rotate about the Z-axis to place the point of the crescent on the Y-axis of the COAS. And this will have your plus X-axis in the direction of the Sun as we discussed before. So the crescent will be up with the point down. Copy that? [Pause.];CDR
113451.2;CDR;"Okay, Jack. We'll have to go over that again. The COAS will be out front window; we'll place the Earth in the center of the COAS, and, let's see, the center of the Earth right now is parallel to the LPD which is about parallel to our X-axis. And we'll have to rotate about 90 degrees to get our X-axis pointing toward the Sun. [Long pause.]";CAPCOM
113506.2;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. So we want to get the Y-axis of the spacecraft parallel to the terminator by putting the points of the crescent on the Y-axis.;CDR
113527.2;CDR; Roger. Understand. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
113549.2;CDR;Seriously, Jack, when I stop the spacecraft looking at - at the Earth, I'm going to have to roll - in LM terms, roll the spacecraft 90 degrees to get the tip of the Earth all on the Y-axis. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
113597.2;CAPCOM;That's affirmative, Jim. You're going to have to roll 90 degrees to point your plus X-axis at the Sun and put the crescent - the points of the crescent on the Y-axis. The points of the crescent on the Y-axis with the COAS pointed at the center of the Earth will take care of your yaw and your pitch. [Pause.];CDR
113628.2;CDR; Roger. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
113650.2;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim. After you get that orientation to come in a little more steeply, we perform an AGS body-axis align which is at 400 plus 5 on the DEDA. If the AGS ball is up at this time, the AGS ball will go to 000. We can talk more about control modes later, but we'd recommend doing this, of course, in AGS Attitude Hold - Attitude Hold. Put your Yaw to Mode Control and leave Pitch and Roll in Pulse, therefore, controlling your attitude with the TTCA. We don't want to use the gimbal, so have Engine Gimbal, Off. We'll make these burns at 10-percent thrust. We'll use a manual start and stop. For ullage, we'll use the Plus-X Translational button, and ullage will be for 10 seconds. Over. [Pause.];CDR
113738.2;CDR; Okay. I understand what you're saying, but you'll have to repeat it here.;CAPCOM
113747.2;CAPCOM;"Okay. We'll perform the burn in Guidance Control to AGS. And Mode Control to Attitude Hold. Your Attitude Control switches will be Roll to Pulse, Pitch to Pulse, and Yaw to Mode Control. So the AGS will control your yaw and you will use the TTCA to control pitch and roll. Engine Gimbal Off; 10-percent thrust. Start and stop manual. For ullage, use the plus-X translational button; 10 seconds ullage. Over. [Long pause.]";CDR
113837.2;CDR;"Okay. For the burn there will be go to Guidance Control AGS, Mode Control Att Hold, Attitude Control switches will be Roll Pulse, Pitch Pulse, Yaw Mode Control. We'll use TTCA control for pitch and roll. Engine Gimbal will be Off; we'll be using 10-percent thrust; we'll start and stop manually, the [garble] ten seconds ullage will be a Plus-X Translational button. And also our thrust will still be, but before that we are going to do an AGS align [garble] ball [Garbled]";CAPCOM
113878.2;CAPCOM;That's affirmative, Jim. After you get oriented in the attitude you want to burn in, do an AGS align which is - an AGS body-axis align which is 400 plus 5. When you get Enter, this will bring ball up to 000, and I want to confirm that you - that you said Engine Gimbal, Off. O-F-F. Over.;CDR
113904.2;CDR; Roger. Confirm that Engine Gimbal will be off. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
113923.2;CDR; And, Jack, how long do you estimate the length of the burns will be?;CAPCOM
113929.2;CAPCOM;Okay. The length of the burns are going to be probably less than a minute. And we want you to have cut-off based on time. So we will give you a burn time. And I have a P30 maneuver pad for midcourse-7 in the event that we lose comm if you are ready to copy. [Long pause.];CDR
113968.2;CDR; Okay, Jack. Ready to copy. [Pause.];CAPCOM
113978.2;CAPCOM;"Okay, Jim. P30 LM maneuver pad: the purpose is midcourse-7. Noun 33 is 134:59:42.98. Noun 81 is N/A. H<sub>A</sub> is N/A. H<sub>P</sub> is plus 0020.5. Delta-V<sub>R</sub> is 0019.3. Burn time, 0:39; 008, 000; the rest is N/A; thrust will be at 10 percent. Read back. [Pause.]";CDR

114096.2;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. That's a good readback, and in the event of lost comm, use the procedures that I gave you. It may be that between now and tomorrow these procedures will change a little bit, so we'll go with what we've got now, and stand by for something better if it comes. Over.;CDR
114120.2;CDR;Okay, Jack. I'm looking at your burn pad and I see that the [garble] total gimbal [garble] 19.3 feet per second. [Pause.];CAPCOM

114394.2;CAPCOM;That's affirmative. That means no maneuvers between now and midcourse 7. And this is a horizontal in-plane burn, plus X, toward the Sun, 19.3 feet per second. [Long pause.];CDR
114444.2;CDR; Roger, understand.;CAPCOM
114543.2;CAPCOM;And, Jim, on the - Setting up the AGS, right after you do the 400 plus 5, you should do a 400 plus all balls. And one other point we want to clarify is that we know that you're sure that this burn will be made with the plus X-axis pointing at the Sun to make the entry angle steeper. You got it?;CDR
114582.2;CDR;" That's right, Jack. What I'm going to do is - We'll stop with the Earth in the commander's window, the COAS down, and then I'm going to maneuver the spacecraft so that I have the lighted portion of the Earth at the top of the window; that is, the COAS will be along the plus-Y of the spacecraft and the top of the window - of the rendezvous window, I should be looking into the Sun. That means I'll be burning towards the Sun and steepening the angle. [Pause.]";CAPCOM
114635.2;CAPCOM;That's affirm, Jim. I - You got the attitude right, and did you copy about doing a 400 plus all balls after - you do the 400 plus 5? That is, a 400 plus 5 and a 400 plus all zeros back to back.;CDR
114654.2;CDR; Roger. I have copied that.;CAPCOM
114767.2;CDR; Jack - this is Aquarius. I'm not too sure how long or with what force the venting is going to do to our trajectory. However, you might keep a check on that. It may have been going on for some time. [Pause.];CAPCOM

114866.2;CDR; Jack, would you give me a time hack on an even GET so I can start my watch.;CAPCOM
114876.2;CAPCOM;Okay. Coming up on 87 hours and 35 minutes, we will be there in 30 seconds. Set it for 87:35.;CDR

114914.6;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CDR
114918.6;CDR;" Okay, Jack. Let's just talk over how I'm going to get to the attitude and then do the burn. What I'm talking about is the control techniques. The way it looks now I'll try to stop the spacecraft in yaw with the Earth out my window. Then we'll be in GUIDANCE or we'll be AGS CONTROL; we'll be in - yaw will be in Mode Control. Then we'll be using the TTCAs to control the pitch and then control the roll. I don't see another way we can control the combination that we have here without using the TTCAs. Then we will also use the TTCA during engine burn. Do you people concur with that technique? [Pause.]";CAPCOM
114924.5;CAPCOM; Jim, that sounds like the one that is best to use to me. Let me talk it over with the rest of the guys here, and we'll advise you.;CDR
114935.5;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
115142.5;CAPCOM;Jim, in that control mode, that sounds like the best way to go. The only thing you'll have to do is to get Attitude Hold in the AGS, and so before you start to maneuver, you'll have to bring the AGS up, and get a 400 plus all zeros in there, and then AGS will respond in yaw when you go to Mode Control. That is, AGS will control your yaw in Mode Control and your pitch and roll can be taken care of in Pulse with a TTCA. After you get in attitude, then, you'll have to re-do an AGS body axis align which is 400 plus 5, then go back to 400 plus all zeros again.;CDR
115195.5;CDR;Right, Jack. That was my next question. I don't want to align the AGS ball 000 until I am in position, so we use that as a primary attitude burn monitor device. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
115224.5;CAPCOM;"And, Jim, you can do a 400 plus all zeros any time you want to; that just tells the AGS that you want it to control your attitude should you go to Attitude Hold in Mode Control.";CDR
115238.5;CDR;Roger. I understand, but after we get to the attitude, we'll do a 400 plus 5 to get the AGS align ball, and then we'll do a 400 plus zero.;CAPCOM
115250.5;CAPCOM; Affirmative. [Long pause.];CDR
115293.5;CAPCOM; Another thing, Jim, is while you're maneuvering to that attitude using AGS to control your yaw, if you find out <i>en route</i> to that attitude that you didn't quite have the yaw where you wanted it to be, you can use your ACA and tweak up the yaw, and your AGS needles go right back to zero because you zero the attitude errors.;CDR

117196.0;CAPCOM; Yes, we thought of that, Jim. [Long pause.];CDR
117217.0;CAPCOM; That is one possibility that we have thought of, Jim, because - We heated up that tank, and we haven't been using any hydrogen and, therefore, it could be venting in the overboard release.;CDR
117235.0;CDR; Right. The only other thing I can think of when I look at it through the AOT is - it did appear to be coming from one spot, but that's the only difference although I can't see where it is coming from because it's beyond the curvature of the Command Module. But, it appears like it might be coming from more than this one spot.;CAPCOM
117259.0;CAPCOM; Okay. Thank you. We hope that when we crank up the Command Module tomorrow that we'll be able to - or later on today - that we will be able to identify more closely what it's been coming from.

117472.0;CDR; Okay, Jack. We're - We're going to set up a regular watch and sleep period here. Fred was up for a long time, so I got up a little bit early to relieve him. Jack and Fred are now asleep, so I'm going to let them sleep as long as they can, and then we'll have an eat period and then I'll go back to bed for a bit. And we'll separate the schedule.;CAPCOM
117500.0;CAPCOM;Okay. We're right at the point now where, according to the Flight Plan that we had made up for you, that you would have all finished eating and you and Jack would have the duty while Fred went to sleep. So, essentially, according to the plan we've got, you got up about 3 or 4 hours early. And - The next time that we have that as a rest period for you is at 96 hours, which is 7 hours from now, and an hour before that, say at 95 hours, all three of you would eat, and then you and Jack would hit the sack again and Fred would have the duty until 102 hours. We'd be glad to take care of this work-rest cycle for you.;CDR
117560.0;CDR; Okay. That's good. Let me - Let me wait until they get up, or at least Jack gets up. He should be getting up before Fred. And we'll try to get back on the schedule. I hate to wake everybody up right now though, if they're sleeping.;CAPCOM
117574.0;CAPCOM; Okay. Your choice on that. As soon as Jack gets up, I'd suggest we go ahead and break up these lithium hydroxide canisters and make a couple of them. Jack could work on that. It's going to take four sets of hands, I think.;CDR

117792.8;CDR; I'll give Jack the headset and let him copy the instruction.;CAPCOM
117797.8;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. The way I thought it might be best to do it would be to have you gather the equirment and let us talk you through your procedure while you do it. Now, maybe you could give Jack the headset and - and - get the equipment together, and we'll talk you through the procedure. I think it'll be a little easier to do that way than if you tried to copy it all down - and then go do it.;CDR
117825.8;CDR; Okay. Do you have any equipment listed? I'll just get it and give it to him and I can just sit here where I am.;CAPCOM
117831.8;CAPCOM; Okay. I think the equipment you'll need will be two Command Module lithium hydroxide canisters, a roll of the gray tape, the two LCGs, because we're going to use the bags from the LCGs, and one - one LM cue card - one of those cardboard cue cards which you will cut off about an inch and a half out from the rings. Now, I think that's all we'll need. Over. [Pause.];CDR

117897.8;CDR; Hello, Houston.;CAPCOM
117899.8;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Jim.;CDR
117902.8;CDR; Okay. That's two lithium hydroxide canisters, one roll of that special gray tape, two LCGs which we're going to use the bags from, one LM cue card and [Garble];CAPCOM
117927.8;CAPCOM;Okay. That's affirmative, Jim. If you'll just cut the cue card, which is a handy piece of stiff paper the right size, about an inch and a half from the rings. Just cut off the ring holes, in other words, and you'll have a card about 11 inches long and probably 6 inches wide, something like that.;CDR
117953.8;CDR; Okay, [garble] I'll have Jack gather up the stuff.;CAPCOM
117956.8;CAPCOM; Okay.;CDR
117962.8;CDR; [garble] that roll of gray tape.;CMP

The first thing we want you to do, and we'll do this on one canister, and then let you go ahead and repeat it on the second. So take one of the LCGs and cut off the outer bag. By cutting along one the heat seals; do it carefully and close to the heat seal, because we may have to use the outer bag if we damage the inner bag. So go ahead and do that, and then we'll do the next step. [Pause.]";CMP
118196.8;CMP; Okay. Take an LCG, cut the outer bag by the heat seal. Be careful not to damage the inner bag. Right?;CAPCOM
118205.8;CAPCOM; Right. Just cut along one side.;CMP
118269.8;CMP; Hey, Houston, Odyssey - or Aquarius. We've done that.;CAPCOM
118274.8;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. Now - now remove the inner bag from the outer bag, and cut the inner bag, also, along one of the heat seals down one side.;CMP
118294.8;CMP; Okay. Remove the inner bag from the outer bag, cut the inner bag along the heat seal along one side.;CAPCOM
118301.8;CAPCOM; Okay. That's correct. Do that, and report. [Long pause.];CMP
118359.8;CMP; Okay, Joe. We've got that done.;CAPCOM
118361.8;CAPCOM;"Okay, Jack. Now you can put the LCG itself; that is, take it out of the inner bag, put it in the outer bag, and stow it some place; we recommend U-1, but you can stow it wherever it's convenient.";CMP
118379.8;CMP; [garble] outer bag [garble] and stow it back in [Garble];CAPCOM
118387.8;CMP; Okay, Joe. We've got that.;CAPCOM
118389.8;CAPCOM; Okay. Now pick up one of the lithium hydroxide canisters, and let me describe which end is which. It's approximately square on one - one of the vented flat ends, has the strap, and that end we call the top, the end opposite we call the bottom. Is that clear? Over.;CMP
118420.8;CMP; Right. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
118433.8;CMP; Okay. I've got it, Joe.;CAPCOM
118436.8;CAPCOM;"Okay. Now then, we're - we want you to take the tape and cut out two pieces about 3 feet long, or a good arm's length, and what you're - what we want you to do with them is to make two belts around the sides of the canister, one belt near the top and one belt near the bottom, with the sticky side out; wrap it around, sticky side out, as tight as possible. It'll probably take both of you to get it nice and snug. Over. [Long pause.]";CMP

118662.0;CAPCOM; Jack...;CMP
118663.0;CMP; ...We've got the two belts around the top and the one around the bottom all done.;CAPCOM
118668.0;CAPCOM;"Okay, fine. The next step now is to anchor that tape, and the way we want you to do that is to cut about a 2-foot length off the roll and then tear it lengthwise so that you have two strips about 2 feet long and about a half an inch wide. And you'll wrap those around the canister at right angles, more or less, to the tape that you've got so that it goes across the top and across the bottom; and when it goes across the top and the bottom, put it so that it's outboard of the center hole and try to get it over one of the ridges between the screens, so that it won't block the flow. Is that clear? Over.";CMP
118713.0;CMP; Yes, Joe. Very good.;CAPCOM
118715.0;CAPCOM; Okay. Press on.;CMP
118720.0;CMP; Okay. I've got a cut length right here and we'll tear it lengthwise [garble] and I'm going to go around right here at this ridge all the way around at right angles and anchor it.;CAPCOM
118741.0;CMP; Yes.;CAPCOM
118744.0;CMP; Joe, just to clarify that, sticky end down. Right? On the tape that I am putting on now?;CAPCOM
118752.0;CAPCOM; I didn't quite copy that, Jack. Say again.;CMP
118756.0;CMP; Okay. That will be the sticky end down on the container, right? [Pause.];CAPCOM
118763.0;CAPCOM; Oh, that's correct. I forgot to say that. That's right. [Long pause.];CMP
118791.0;CMP; [garble] hold that one right here, if I can set it.;CAPCOM
118906.0;CMP;" Okay, Joe; Aquarius. We've got that done.";CAPCOM
118910.0;CAPCOM;" Okay, Jack. The next step is to get the EVA cue card and use it to form an arch over the top of the canister; just tuck one short end under one ridge on the top the other one against the ridge on the other side so that it forms a rounded arch over the top of the canister. You see, Jack, what we're going to do is slip the bag over this whole assembly and the cue card will serve to keep the bag from being sucked down against the screen. Over.";CMP
118948.0;CMP; Okay. I got the idea.;CAPCOM
118951.0;CAPCOM; Okay. And when you've done that, to hold the arch in place, just run a strip of tape across the side of the - that is, across the top of the arch, and anchor it down to the sticky strips along each side.;CMP
118969.0;CMP; Okay. I got the idea. Okay. Let me just repeat it here. Take a cue card, form an arch over the top, bringing it under the side here. When we're through, run a piece of tape from the sides across the top of that to anchor to the other side.;CAPCOM
118989.0;CAPCOM; That's correct.;CMP
118994.0;CMP; Okay. It worked.;CAPCOM
118998.0;CMP; The top. [garble] Across the top.;CAPCOM
119016.0;CMP; Looks like you're going to have to cut the cue card slightly. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
119030.0;CMP; Doesn't have to be really [garble] over that the only thing we're [garble] we can just take the scissors and cut off the edge here. The only thing this does, Jim, is prevent this from being sucked down into the container. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
119086.0;CMP; Still going to need some more tape. Cut off the end. Okay. Whack off the bottom. [Garble].;CAPCOM
119105.4;CMP; Okay, Joe. We've got that arch built, and it's all taped in securely.;CAPCOM
119112.4;CAPCOM;" Okay, Jack. The next step is to stop up the bypass hole, which is the hole in the center of the bottom of the canister; we want to stop that up because we don't want to bypass the flow; and I forgot to tell you to get something to stick in that hole. We recommend that you either use a wet wipe, or cut off a piece of sock and stuff it in there, or you could probably even crumble up some tape and use that. Over.";CMP
119144.4;CMP; Okay. We'll start plugging up the bypass hole.;CAPCOM
119148.4;CAPCOM; Okay.;CMP
119149.4;CMP; Plug that hole. We can either - we can put some either - Let's cut a piece of your towel there.;CAPCOM
119162.1;CAPCOM; Sounds good.;CMP
119329.1;CMP;" Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We have the bypass hole all plugged up.";CAPCOM
119336.1;CAPCOM; Okay, Aquarius. The next step is take the inner LCG bag that you cut open, and slip it over the top of the canister, when you do that, orient it so that the ears of the bag, that is, the corners should stick out on the closed end - are oriented along the open ends of the arch, because we're going to snip one of those corners to stick the hose in. Pull it down until it fits snugly over the arch. Over. [Pause.];CMP
119371.1;CMP; Okay, Joe. Slip the bag over the canister so that the arch is at the bottom of the bag and that the ears are along oriented along, let's see - I guess it would be - would be at the sides of the arch.;CAPCOM
119394.1;CAPCOM; Depends on what you mean by sides - over the - the open ends of the arch.;CMP
119401.1;CMP; Right, the open ends of the arch.;CAPCOM
119403.1;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];CMP
119452.1;CMP; Okay, Joe. We've got that done.;CAPCOM
119455.1;CAPCOM;Okay. Now press the bag against the sticky belts that we put on the sides of the canister. If there is any excess material, just kind of pleat it, so that it makes a fairly tight seal, and then take another 3-foot strip of sticky tape and wrap it around the outside of the bag opposite the bottom - the bottom sticky belt - to make a nice tight seal.;CMP
119485.1;CMP; Okay. I'll do it. Okay. Now they want two strips around here to make a tight seal.;CAPCOM
119503.3;CMP; Okay, Joe. We've got the canister inside the bag, two strips around the sides of the bag, real tight, and both sealed.;CAPCOM
119512.3;CAPCOM;"Okay; real fine. Now there's probably a couple of inches of excess bag sticking out around the bottom of the canister. To prevent this from sucking in against the bottom screen, we'd like you to trim it off with the scissors, and when you've done that, we'd like you to cut two more strips of tape about 12 inches long or so, cut the - tear them lengthwise to get four pieces 12 inches long and Â½-inch wide, and then use those four strips to secure the bag by passing the strips from the sides of the canister outside the bag around the bottom of the canister and back up the other side, and when you do this, just as you did on the top, make them go outward of the hole and in between the screens. Over.";CMP
119567.3;CMP;" Okay. You want me to trim the excess material that's sticking off here; trim it at the edge of that canister? Or do you want any excess left over? [Pause.]";CAPCOM
119577.3;CAPCOM; No, you don't need to have any excess. Just trim it approximately level.;CMP
119584.3;CMP; Okay. Let's do that first.;CAPCOM
119586.3;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];CMP
119643.3;CMP;Okay. Now, Joe, you want to cut four strips, 12 inches long each, 1/2-inch in diameter. Tape that along the outsides of the bag across the ribs.;CAPCOM
119660.3;CAPCOM; That's correct, Jack. That's just for additional security on the bag. When you get those done, you'll have - You'll have two strips going one way, and the other two will be perpendicular to them.;CMP
119678.9;CMP;" Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We've got the four strips in place.";CAPCOM
119683.9;CAPCOM; Okay. We're in business now with the bag, and the next step to perform is to get ready to put the red suit hose, either the commander's or the LMP's because we're - we're going to want you to have both of these made up eventually, into the top of the - of the bag, and to do that you, first of all, have to assure that the - that the red hose is separated from the blue hose. I don't know whether this has been done already, but if it hasn't, what you have to do is cut the outer Beta-cloth sheath down the full length of the - of the hoses and then also cut the rubber ties that secure the two hoses together, and the hoses should come apart and the comm cable should - should come off. Over. [Pause.];CMP
119744.9;CMP; Okay. Take the - I'm going to want to separate the red hose from the blue hose by cutting this Beta-cloth sheath. Okay. That's in work.;CAPCOM
119755.9;CAPCOM; Okay.;CMP
119852.9;CMP; Okay, Houston, Aquarius. I have the LMP's red hose separated from the others.;CAPCOM
119860.9;CAPCOM;Okay. Real fine. Now the next step is to cut a diagonal hole in one ear of the - of the plastic bag near the arch. You can pick either one and cut about, a 1Â½- or 2-inch diagonal hole, big enough to slip the red hose through. And when you've done that, you'll just slip the red hose through so that it goes about to the center of the canister. It's - it's - It's not critical except that the opening should be down, and then tape the bag to the hose wher'e it goes in so that it's nice and snug. Over;CMP
119900.9;CMP;Okay. Copy that. We want a 1Â½-inch hole right here at this ear, and put the hose in here, end down and toward the canister and then we tape the seal around here.  [Long pause.];CAPCOM

120150.0;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.;CMP
120156.0;CMP; Okay. Our do-it-yow'self lithium hydroxide canister change is complete. Joe, the only thing different is that our arch on this piece of cardboard is not big enough to position the red hose with the inlet down, and the inlet - the inlet to - to the red hose is lying on its side, but I think it'll still work.;CAPCOM
120183.0;CAPCOM; Ok my, Jack. I concur. I think it'll work, too. There's one step that I omitted, which you can do now quite conveniently, and it's this. Where you stuff the towel in the bypass hole on the bottom, we recommend that you cut a few short pieces of tape and just tape that over so it doesn't fall out. Over.;CMP
120207.0;CMP; Okay. Will do. Jim, I've got one more little thing to do, and that's [garble] seal that top.;CAPCOM
120278.0;CMP; Okay, Joe. That's done.;CAPCOM
120280.0;CAPCOM;Okay, Jack. Now the remaining steps are simply suit-loop configuration steps to get this thing into full operation, and our ECS people want to hold off on that until the canister you're working on gets to 7.6 millimeters of mercury, which will probably be another 45 minutes or an hour - it - We're reading 4.7 now. So what we'd like you to do in the interim is to set up the second Command Module canister the same way you just did the first one, using the commander's hose, and get that all set and probably about that time it'll be time to - to switch over. For your information, when you've got that done and if you've had your breakfast and so on, the next thing I've got for you is a switch-configuration list for the Command Module, which will represent the - the power down, square-1 starting configuration for all our - our preentry checks. Over.;CMP
120349.0;CMP; Okay. We'll start setting up the commander's hose configuration the same as the LMP's hose. And I'll get - instead of - I guess you want me to use my launch [garble] - launch checklist which I'd [Garble];CAPCOM
120370.0;CAPCOM; That's affirmative, Jack. What we have done is marked up the lift-off configuration checklist, and we'll run through it whenever you get around to it.;CMP

120442.0;CMP; Okay, Joe. Should this canister be in operation now because it's already mounted on the hose?;CAPCOM
120447.0;CAPCOM; Well, yes. We haven't completely configured the suit loop to get full flow through there, and it's okay the way it is. What I recommend you do with the commander's hose is get the bag all ready, but not stick the hose in until we call you on it. Okay.;CMP
120469.0;CMP; Okay. Will do.;CAPCOM

123891.8;CMP; Okay. Real good, Joe. [Garble] configures for that panel.;CAPCOM
123898.8;CAPCOM; Okay. You can get those configures when you can. And the next order of business I've got for you is a procedure to verify that Main Bus B is good. And a little after that, we'll want to read up to you, for your future information, a procedure for transferring LM power to the Command Module. Over.;CMP
123923.8;CMP; Okay. That sounds good. You want to get this PLSS configuration done first before you give those other procedures, huh?;CAPCOM
123934.8;CAPCOM;Yes, I think so. Stand by 1 second and I'll see if Flight has any words for us before you start that. [Long pause.];CMP

123998.8;CAPCOM; Yes, okay. Understand they are all up. Did you say you wanted to copy the other procedure now? Over.;CMP
124007.8;CMP; I can if you want. It's your choice.;CAPCOM
124010.8;CAPCOM; I'd rather you went ahead with the switch configuration, Jack.;CMP
124016.8;CMP; Okay, let's do that and then I'll be back with you.;CAPCOM
124020.8;CAPCOM; Okay. See you later. And tell Jim that Deke wants him to go to bed.;CMP

124100.8;CMP;[garble] like that [garble] I got up about 1 hour [Garble]. [Long pause.];CDR
124161.8;CMP; You know what I thought - I think what we saw venting was the result of our Delta-Vs stirring up things, popping the relief valve. Yes. We don't see anything venting now. [Garble] [Pause.];CAPCOM
124193.8;CMP; Okay, Houston. We are standing by. [Pause.];CAPCOM
124202.8;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;CMP
124206.8;CMP; Okay, Joe.;CAPCOM
124208.8;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. You can go ahead and set up that switch configuration. What we are discussing is having you activate the Main Bus Tie motor switches a little later on simply to verify that they will be okay, because the batteries are probably getting a little bit cool. But we'll be back to you with a procedure and discussion about that after you get the switch configuration set up. Over.;CMP
124237.8;CMP; Okay, I'm going to go get the switch configuration done now before Jim goes to bed so I don't disturb him.;CAPCOM
124245.8;CAPCOM; Okay. Real fine.;CMP
124250.8;CMP;Jim thinks Deke sounds like Frank Borman on Apollo 8.;CAPCOM

124312.8;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.;CDR
124317.8;CDR;Okay, before I hit the sack, Joe, I just want to make sure - How are you still planning an MCC at 107 and what's the latest find?;CAPCOM
124326.8;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim. We are still gathering our thoughts on the MCC, but some of the considerations go like this: FIDO tells us that we can do that correction probably as late as 118 hours, with no significant Delta-V penalty, and with plenty of tracking thereafter to make sure that we've done the right thing, and to set you up for a late MCC if we need it, which we probably wouldn't. We are happy with the PTC mode that you are in now, and, although we are working up a - an AGS PTC mode to use after the midcourse correction, we'd kind of like you to stay in this PTC for a while because it is doing good. We are looking at the weather in the landing area. We don't think we'll have a problem but we are checking it real close, and if there is any changing that we want to do, we want to get it into this midcourse correction. And for reasons like that, we are - we are considering possibly delaying the midcourse correction from 104 hours to sometime between there and 118. We'd like to know what you think about it. Over.;CDR
124403.8;CDR;" We have no druthers. As long as we do the midcourse and there is plenty of tracking thereafter to correct for another midcourse; that's my only concern.";CAPCOM
124414.8;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim. Roger that. And based on FIDO's input that he'd like to do it not later than 24 hours before EI, we will be doing it prior to 118 hours.;CDR
124427.8;CDR; Okay. [Long pause.];LMP
124468.8;LMP;" Hello, Houston; Aquarius.";CAPCOM
124473.8;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Go.;LMP
124478.8;LMP; Question, Joe. Jim has been talking to me about how we are going to do this midcourse, and awhile back when we went through this power up, we had pulled the Stab/Control ASA breaker. I was wondering - we lost the heaters in the ASA - I was wondering how it looked? What kind of shape it's going to be in?;CAPCOM
124508.8;CAPCOM; Okay. Stand by on that one, Fred.;LMP
124514.8;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
124538.8;CAPCOM; Fred, Houston.;LMP
124542.8;LMP; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
124543.8;CAPCOM;Roger. I am told that we'd see 38 degrees for that package, and it'll be okay for the burn. We're massaging the detail procedures for this burn at this time and we expect to have a real clean setup to you in plenty of time.;LMP
124562.8;LMP; Okay, very good. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
124580.8;LMP;And I don't know if Jack passed it on to you, but Jack and I just finished logging about 6 hours sleep, each. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
124601.8;CAPCOM; Roger, Fred. Copy that. Is it a little chilly up there?;LMP
124608.8;LMP;" Yes. We made the mistake of putting up the window shades, which we won't do again; and with this powered-down mode, we're not generating much internally, and it really did get chilly.";CAPCOM
124623.8;CAPCOM; Yes. I guess you'll have to generate your own heat in there for a while.;LMP
124629.8;CAPCOM; Deke says unstow the Exer-Genie. [Pause.];LMP
124636.8;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
124648.0;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;LMP
124653.0;LMP; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
124655.0;CAPCOM;Fred, just wanted to let you know in advance that we're coming up on the redline CO<sub>2</sub> value for the secondary canister, and we expect to get there in something like a half hour, at which time we'll be asking you to switch over to the Command Module canisters. I have the rest of that procedure ready and I just wanted to warn you a little bit in advance. Over.;LMP
124681.0;LMP; Okay. And I've got a question for you, Joe.;CAPCOM
124686.0;CAPCOM; Go ahead.;LMP
124692.0;LMP; Okay. The - I need to find out if the condensate container that we were going to use to strain some water in on the lunar surface - is that container also completely airtight? Okay to use it to put fluid in through here in zero g?;CAPCOM

124752.0;CAPCOM; Oh, that's much better. Go ahead.;LMP
124757.0;LMP; Okay. I was just going to say we haven't had an overboard waste water dump since clear back around the other side of the Moon. About this time, we're running out of the bags we've got on board here. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
124784.0;CAPCOM; Okay. I'm - I'm stupid this morning, Fred. I'm not quite sure what you are getting at.;LMP
124795.0;LMP; Okay, Joe. We need some place to put the urine.;CAPCOM
124799.0;CAPCOM; Okay. It sounds to me as if the suggested receptacle is perfectly satisfactory. Do you think you can use it in its present configuration?;LMP
124815.0;LMP;Oh, yes. We got all the interconnects - hookups we need, but I wasn't sure if that gadget was devised solely with the 1/6g environment in mind, and whether it might leak somehow in zero g. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
124831.0;CAPCOM; I'll have them verify that, but off the top of my head, I'm sure it's going to be all right. We'll check it, Fred.;LMP
124840.0;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
124851.2;LMP; Okay. How do you read, Joe?;CAPCOM
124862.4;LMP; Houston, Aquarius. [Pause.];CAPCOM
124870.4;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.;LMP
124875.4;LMP; Okay, Joe. One thing I've noticed, that a couple of circuits there now - the pulse [garble] - at least the number of them, is markedly decreased, and [garble] rather bad and, apparently, that added venting we had out of the Service Module was some overboard relief valve, maybe letting go, because it appears to have stopped now.;CAPCOM

125124.9;CAPCOM; ...Why don't you try it now? You're loud and clear now, Fred.;LMP
125128.9;LMP; Okay. I was just - I'm getting Master Alarms every few seconds and I am catching a glimmer now of the ECS light. For the time being, I have [garble] - [garble] open. Okay, now we got the ECS light on steady.;CAPCOM
125153.9;CAPCOM; Okay. Copy that. You have the Master Alarm, with the ECS light. We are ready to go ahead and get you on the Command Module canisters. And as the first step, I'd like to know whether you've inserted the commander's red hose to the second canister bag. Over.;LMP

125300.0;LMP; Okay. One correction - the red hose that's connected up right now to the lithium cartridge in the LMP's - Wait a minute.;CAPCOM
125320.0;CAPCOM;Okay, Fred. Understand only the LMP's red hose is actually plugged into the canister bag. In that case, we would like you to follow the procedure for inserting the other red hose in the other canister bag as follows: you cut a diagonal hole in one corner of the bag. Look at the other bag and see how it was done. Stick the hose in about 6 inches. Try to get the outlet nozzle down if you can, or else sideways, and then just tape up the hose to the bag to make a nice tight seal. Over.;LMP
125365.0;LMP; Okay. Jack's back in here. I guess he can do that. Stand by.;CAPCOM

126599.0;CMP;No, let me see if I've got it here. I go down to panel 275, open CB Main A, Bat Bus A and CB Main B, Bat Bus B. Then I go down to 250, and pull CB Bat A Power Entry/Postlanding and Bat B Power Entry/Postlanding and then up on panel 5, pull EPS Sensor Signal Main A, Sensor Signal Main B, Battery Charger Bat B Charge, Battery Charger Bat A Charge. And then close - I don't know whether you want me to close the Rendezvous Radar Transponder Flight Bus and S-Band Transmitter/DSE Flight Bus.;CAPCOM
126645.0;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. We don't want you to close those last two. Those are changes to your basic configuration, and we want to leave them open for now. Over.;CMP
126657.0;CMP; Okay. I'll do that. Was the rest of the readback okay?;CAPCOM
126659.0;CAPCOM;That's correct. Readback was 100 per cent, and we'll wait to hear from you. [Pause.];CMP
126674.0;CMP;Okay, Joe. And just for confirmation, I went through the switch list you gave me. We are in exactly that configuration with one exception, and that is over on panel 382.

127192.8;CAPCOM;And Fred, Houston. In a little while here, I'm going to have a procedure that I want to read up to you and have you copy down for future use. It's a procedure for powering the Command Module main bus off the LM, and it's something that we feel that's going to come in real handy later on for such things as topping off the Command Module entry batteries, and also possibly for doing some preheating and preliminary powering up of the Command Module before we get rid of the LM.

128069.2;LMP; Okay. Two things: first of all, we noticed a [Garble];CAPCOM
128080.2;CAPCOM;" Gol darn it. Just as you started talking, it got noisy again, Fred; try it again.";LMP
128087.2;LMP; Okay. [Pause.];CAPCOM

128101.2;LMP; Okay. Jack had a question on how far out from the Moon are we now? [Pause.];CAPCOM
128114.2;CAPCOM; On how far out what?;LMP
128118.2;LMP; From the Moon we are now?;CAPCOM
128120.2;CAPCOM;Oh. Our little plot shows you just touching the 180-thousand-mile line. So you're about 40 K out from the Moon.;LMP
128130.2;LMP; Okay. Okay. And the other thing is, we've noticed some fresh new particles floating around outside, so possibly the Service Module is starting to vent a little bit again.;CAPCOM
128149.2;CAPCOM;Okay. Copy that, Fred. On the O<sub>2</sub> flow thing, we clearly saw the Demand Regulator go to Off and back to Cabin. TELMU thinks that it's no big thing that you've seen a little change in flow due to the different resistance we've got in the circuit.;LMP

129085.6;CAPCOM;It's about - I'd say 15 to 20 steps, Jack. Some of it is LM stuff, and the rest of it is in CSM.;CMP
129099.6;CMP; Okay. I got a fresh page here, and I'm ready to copy.;CAPCOM
129102.6;CAPCOM;Okay. I'll give you the LM steps first. They have to be done first, and the first step is on panels 11 and 16, circuit breakers Ascent ECA, ASC ECA, two to close. Over. [Pause.];CMP
129126.6;CMP;Okay. Panels 11 and 16 CBs Ascent ECA to closed.;CAPCOM

129233.6;CAPCOM;That's correct, and the last LM step for now is Bats 2 and 4 to Off/Reset. Over. [Long pause.];CMP
129254.6;CMP;Okay. Bats 2 and 4 to Off/Reset.;CAPCOM
129259.6;CAPCOM; That's correct. Now we'll go to the CSM, and the first step there is connect LM/CSM umbilical. Over. [Pause.];CMP
129277.6;CMP; Okay. Connect LM/CSM umbilical.;CAPCOM
129281.6;CAPCOM;Okay. The next step on panel 5, CB LM Power-1 Main B and LM Power-2 Main B, both, closed. Over. [Pause.];CMP
129307.6;CMP;Okay. On panel 5, CB LM Power-1 Main B and 2 Main B, both, closed.;CAPCOM

129398.6;CMP; Okay. That's verify the Main Bus voltage, and switch LM Power to CSM.;CAPCOM
129407.6;CAPCOM;Okay. That's correct. Then go back to 275, CB Main B Bat Bus B to open. Hey, Jack, that's the step I skipped for you, I'm afraid. Before verifying Main Bus voltage, you have to, on panel 275, close CB Main B Bat Bus B. Over. [Long pause.];CMP
129451.6;CMP; Okay, Joe. How are you reading on the Aft Omni.;CAPCOM
129455.6;CAPCOM; You're okay now. Go ahead.;CMP
129459.6;CMP;Okay. After putting the Battery B Power Entry/Postlanding On, then I want to push the - on panel 275 Main B to Bat Bus B in, huh? [Pause.];CAPCOM
129482.6;CAPCOM;That's right. Then you go to verify Main Bus voltage, LM Power to CSM, and then, on panel 275, circuit breaker Main B Bat Bus B to open. Over.;CMP
129497.6;CMP; Okay. After verifying the Main Bus voltage connecting the LM Power to CSM I want to pull Main B Bat Bus B, or Main B to Bat Bus B, open.;CAPCOM

129541.6;CMP;Okay. Panel 250 Bat B Power Entry/Postlanding open, and then verify the Main Bus voltage.;CAPCOM
129548.6;CAPCOM;Okay. That's correct. The last, steps are to get LM back to descent batteries. The first step is Bats 1, 2, 3 and 4, Hi Voltage, On, Over. [Long pause.];CMP
129576.6;CMP;Okay. Then the next step is a LM step, Bats 1, 2, 3 and 4, Hi Voltage, On.;CAPCOM
129583.6;CAPCOM;That's correct, and the last step in LM, Bats 5 and 6 to Off. Over. [Pause.];CMP
129597.6;CMP; Okay. Say again you cut out there, Joe.;CAPCOM
129600.6;CAPCOM;Okay, Jack. The last step in LM, Batteries 5 and 6 to Off. Over.;CMP
129611.6;CMP;Okay, Bats 5 and 6 to Off.;CAPCOM
129615.6;CAPCOM;That's correct. That should configure you. Note that circuit-breakers, protection on that circuit limits the available current to 15 amps. We think we can do quite a bit with it though. And the LM/CSM umbilical will be hot and Main Bus voltage may be monitored by selecting Main B on the gage. Over.;CMP
129640.6;CMP; Okay. Real fine.;CAPCOM
129642.6;CAPCOM; Good deal, Jack.;CMP
129646.6;CMP; Okay. And I'll be ready to implement this whenever you call it up.;CAPCOM
129650.6;CAPCOM; Roger that. [Long pause.];CMP
129678.6;LMP; And how do you read, Joe?;CAPCOM
129680.6;CAPCOM; Pretty good, Fred.;LMP
129684.6;LMP;Okay. While Jack was on comm, I was looking out the docking window here, and I could see another good shower off particles coming out of the Service Module. And the position this time appears to be on the other side. Before, we'd always seen them out of window 1, and where I'm looking at it from here, it looks like it'd be down below window 6 somewhere in the Service Module. Jack's going upstairs to see what it looks like up there.;CAPCOM
129717.6;CAPCOM; Okay. Good deal. We copy that, Fred. And to show you how relaxed we are about the entry, Ken is looking at - giving you guys a chance to - prior to going into entry, Prep to snap a few pictures of the Service Module. [Pause.];LMP
129740.6;LMP; Ken is, huh? (Laughter);CAPCOM
129746.6;CAPCOM; Yes, he's got all that film up there, and he doesn't want to waste it.;LMP
129750.6;LMP; Oh, I thought maybe you'd want me to do a PLSS EVA to go shoot pictures or something.;CAPCOM
129755.6;CAPCOM; Okay, okay. [Pause.];LMP
129766.6;LMP;" You're right; we got a lot of pictures. [Pause.]";CMP
129778.6;LMP; I guess I agree it surely would be nice to document it someway if we can, but it doesn't look like [Garble].;CMP
129789.6;CAPCOM; Yes, we think it'd be a lot of help. [Long pause.];LMP
129845.6;LMP; Joe, how do you read me?;CAPCOM
129849.6;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.;LMP
129854.6;LMP; Okay. The condensate transfer worked great.;CAPCOM
129861.6;CAPCOM; Stand by a minute, Fred. We're in a bad comm mode.;LMP
129864.6;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
129880.6;LMP; Okay. How's that?;CAPCOM
129881.6;CAPCOM; That's better.;LMP
129885.6;LMP; Okay. The waste transfer into the condensate can works real well, Joe.;CAPCOM
129893.6;CAPCOM; Okay. Good deal.;LMP
129897.6;LMP; So, I guess we can keep FIDO happy with no overboard dumps.;CAPCOM
129903.6;CAPCOM; Roger that. (Long pause.);LMP
129938.6;LMP; Yes, that brings up one more possibility, Joe.;CAPCOM
129943.6;CAPCOM; Say again, Fred.;LMP
129947.6;LMP; Brings up another possibility. Now that we've got all of that stowed into the bags and the condensate can, we could probably blow all of that through the PLSS [Garble], I wonder how the sublimator would work on waste water.;CAPCOM
129963.6;CAPCOM;It might work if we had to do it, Fred. Right now we're looking at a comfortable excess of water through the sublimator. We were talking among ourselves this morning about having you try out the PLSS to ascent tank water-transfer situation and we decided not to do it, not to recommend it, because we figure it'd take us 30 hours to empty one of the ascent tanks, which you have to do in order to get PLSS water to it, and we'd rather use the descent water and we don't think we've gotten any sweat. Over.;LMP
130005.6;LMP; Okay, Joe. I don't think there's any question about it from the plumbing standpoint that we could do that if we had to. [Pause.];CAPCOM
130020.6;CAPCOM; Okay. Copy that.;LMP
130037.0;LMP; And, how do you read, Joe?;CMP
130042.0;CAPCOM; Read you pretty good, Fred. Go ahead.;LMP
130047.0;LMP; I think our PTC wobble is growing worse. The Earth now is really up to the top of the window. I have to get way down almost to the floorboards to view it. Conversely, the Moon is way down at the bottom of the window. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
130068.0;CAPCOM; Okay.;LMP
130071.0;LMP; A lot more wobble.;CAPCOM
130072.0;CAPCOM; Roger ...;LMP
130073.0;LMP; Far more wobble than I noticed on my previous watch.;CAPCOM
130081.0;CAPCOM;Okay. Copied that, Fred. And our thermal people will be looking at it. One of the things we're talking about relative to the midcourse correction is we'd like not to do it before the SHe tank goes, if it's going to go, just so it won't give us a problem reestablishing PTC. And right now our people think that the burst disk will pop around 106 hours.;LMP
130114.0;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
130123.2;LMP; The L-shaped bag is [garble].;CAPCOM
130133.6;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;LMP
130139.6;LMP; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
130140.6;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. Since you went ahead and used the PLSS condensate container, we got the procedure in for using it. I'm not going to read it up to you except that it cautions a little bit about shaking it too much or about filling it too full, because they feel that if you do that the vent valve might unseat and the bag might leak a little bit. Over.;LMP
130170.6;LMP; Okay. We haven't removed it from its stowage spot. We just left it right in place, and just - he mated the tank at the end of the cable and hooked right into that.;CAPCOM
130185.6;CAPCOM; Understand. That's satisfactory and recommended that you leave it in the stowage spot. That should help the situation.;LMP
130197.6;LMP; Roger. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
130247.6;LMP;We got a - we got another flow shower going on outside. Particles, seeing them vented against the Service Module. Jack thinks it may be an H<sub>2</sub> vent. [Garble];CAPCOM
130261.6;CAPCOM; Okay. Copy that. What window are you looking at it out of, Fred?;LMP
130268.6;LMP; Out the LM docking window.;CAPCOM
130270.6;CAPCOM;The docking window. Roger that. Somebody just handed me your latest consumables status report, and you're using between 11 to 12 amps an hour real steady, and it looks real good. [Long pause.];LMP
130287.6;LMP; Roger.;CMP
130305.6;CMP; Joe, what are you showing for GET now?;LMP
130310.6;CAPCOM;I think you wanted the GET, Jack, and the present GET is 96 hours 21 minutes. Over.;CMP
130321.6;CMP; Okay, thank you.;CAPCOM
130323.6;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];CMP
130336.6;CAPCOM; And Jack, Houston. For your information, FIDO tells me that we are in the Earth's sphere of influence and we're starting to accelerate.;CDR
130349.6;CMP; I thought it was about time we crossed. Thank you.;CAPCOM
130353.6;CAPCOM; Roger.;CMP
130359.6;CMP; We're on our way back home. [Pause.];CAPCOM
130369.6;CMP; There's something that puzzles me, Joe. Vance mentioned yesterday that the planned entry is a CMC-guided entry, so I'm kind of curious as how are we going to get the alignment.;CAPCOM
130389.6;CAPCOM; Did you say how we're going to get guidance? Over.;CMP
130394.6;CMP; No. How are we going to get a platform alignment?;CAPCOM
130398.6;CAPCOM; Okay. We got a number of interesting ideas on that and the latest one I've heard is to power up the LM platform and align it, and align the CM platform to it.;CMP
130412.6;CMP; Okay. That sounds good.;CAPCOM
130414.6;CAPCOM; Okay. And we're working out detailed procedures on that, Jack.;CMP
130419.6;CMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
130425.6;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;CMP
130430.6;CMP; Go ahead, Joe.;CAPCOM
130431.6;CAPCOM;Okay. We are taking our final look at the midcourse procedures and we have a question as to the present position of one of the switches. The switch is the AGS Status switch on panel 6. We'd just like to know where it's at.;CMP
130451.6;CMP; Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
130468.6;CMP; Okay, Joe. The AGS Status switch is Off.;CAPCOM

130480.8;LMP; Houston, Aquarius. [Pause.];CAPCOM
130491.8;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.;LMP
130496.8;LMP; Okay, Vance. I just heard a little thump, sounded like down in the descent stage, and I saw a new shower of snowflakes come up that looked like they were emitted from down that way. We've already decided though ... I wonder what the Supercrit pressure looked like now.;CAPCOM
130516.8;CAPCOM; Okay. Understand you saw a thump in the descent stage and a few snowflakes. We'll take a look down here, see if we see anything. [Long pause.];LMP
130560.8;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. [Long pause.];LMP
130580.8;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;LMP
130584.8;LMP; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
130586.8;CAPCOM; Fred, we don't see anything wrong. For example, your SHe appears to be okay as far as we can see. The thing we don't have data on, is the start tank down there.;LMP
130604.8;LMP; Okay. And I doubt if it would have been that anyway.;CAPCOM
130609.8;CAPCOM; Okay. While we have you on the horn ...;LMP
130611.8;LMP; We're still getting ...;CAPCOM
130616.8;CAPCOM; Roger. Still getting it.;LMP
130617.8;LMP; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
130619.8;CAPCOM; While you're on the horn, be advised our calculations show you might be running out of potable water in the CSM pretty soon. Also, that you might start to have hydrogen tank venting in the CSM and a question. Next time Jack looks through the sextant and telescope, we'd like him to see how it looks. Do you have anything on the optics, any specks or anything?;LMP
130654.8;LMP; Okay, [Garble];CAPCOM
130663.8;LMP; Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?;CAPCOM
130667.8;CAPCOM;Aquarius, we read you 4 by 4. Go ahead.;LMP
130673.8;LMP; Okay. It looks like the PTC is deteriorated enough that [Garble] the docking window of the LM, and [Garble] [Pause.];CAPCOM
130713.8;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. We got part of your transmission. Understand the PTC has deteriorated quite a bit and you'd like to know what to do about it. Is that affirm?;LMP
130728.8;LMP; Negative. How do you read now, Vance?;CAPCOM
130730.8;CAPCOM; Okay. A little better.;LMP
130734.8;LMP; Okay. The only comment was that it has deteriorated to where the Moon is now coming through the overhead docking window now, in a portion of each pass, and about that time I just lose comm on either antenna, so there's going to be a short period of time on each revolution where we're not going to have Comm.;CAPCOM
130756.8;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. We understand that and one more item for clarification on the water. We don't really know what your usage of potable is. That was purely an estimate assuming a fairly healthy usage.;LMP
130775.8;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
130788.2;LMP;" Hey, Houston; Aquarius.";CAPCOM
130794.2;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.;LMP
130799.2;LMP; Okay. Jack just took a look through the optics ... through one Rev, and he said they look good, loud and clear. He doesn't have any current condensate on either the sextant or telescope.;CAPCOM
130814.2;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. Thanks for the info.;LMP
130825.7;LMP; How do you read, Vance?;CAPCOM
130829.7;CAPCOM; Okay. I'm reading you weakly, Fred. Go ahead.;LMP

132076.6;CAPCOM; Roger, Jim. We concur. Go ahead and turn it on.;CDR
132081.6;CDR;" Okay. Fine; thank you.";CAPCOM
132085.6;CAPCOM; One other point. The philosophy of timing this midcourse is based a little bit on doing it just before the SHe tank is supposed to vent. That way, we hope that we would have ... be powered up and you would have control when the venting occurs, in case you were tossed around a little bit. Over.;CDR
132108.6;CDR;Okay. Understand. Philosophy on the midcourse is doing it, prior to venting of the SHe tank, which means we'll be doing this around 105 hours, I suppose, or 105:30 and so I'll have control of the spacecraft if it should give us some perturbation.;CAPCOM
132129.6;CAPCOM; Roger. Then, after that, we would establish PTC again.;CDR

134209.3;LMP;" That's affirmative. Add that in to the top of the page. The ... What we're really doing ... Let's ... let's put it in to right before the ""AGS Activation."" The other ... the other procedure on the top of the page belongs with the ""DAP Set Gimbal Trim,"" and we're just omitting all of that procedure. So the addition that ... on the damping, the rates should really go in right before the ""AGS Activation."" Over.";CDR
134240.3;CDR; Understand.;LMP
134242.3;LMP;"What we're really trying to do is get you in a posture so that when you see the Earth come through the window, you can damp her out and hold ... hold the Earth in the window. Proceeding on to the rest of page 29, under ""RCS Press,"" scratch the entire three steps as printed. On page 30, scratch step 4 under the ""RCS Press."" Over. [Pause.]";CDR
134275.3;CDR;"Roger. Under ""AGS Activation,"" well, I included that step on the ASA circuit breaker and we'll do step 1 and 2 ander ""AGS Activation."" But then we'll scratch steps 1, 2, and 3 under ""RCS Press"" and, on page 30, we'll scratch step 4.";LMP
134292.3;LMP;"Affirm. Under ""DPS Press,"" step 1, line 1, scratch. Line 4, ""Descent Helium Reg 1, talkback barber pole."" Under step 2, scratch; step 3, scratch; ""Landing Gear Deploy,"" scratch. Over.";CDR
134327.3;CDR;"Okay. Under ""DPS Press,"" we'll scratch the first line and we'll have the ""Descent Helium Reg, talkback to barber pole."" We'll scratch steps 2 and 3, and we'll scratch the ""Landing Gear Deploy.""";LMP
134343.3;LMP;Roger. Now we got, on the back of page 30, Jim, you've got a blank page in your checklist, or should have, and we'd like to add a procedure to get you to burn attitude. Over.;CDR
134360.3;CDR; Okay. A procedure to get the burn attitude.;LMP
134364.3;LMP;"Okay. First statement is a statement: ""Verify AGS in Operate for 5 minutes."" Then we go to ""AGS address 400 plus 5, then 400 plus zero. Attitude Control: Pitch and Roll to Pulse; Yaw, Mode Control. Maneuver using TTCA pitch and roll."" The computer is controlling yaw, but you can override with ACA. You with me? Over. [Long pause.]";CDR
134468.3;CDR; Okay, Charlie. I'm with you so far.;LMP
134471.3;LMP;" Okay, Jim. ""When in attitude, ACA out of detent to zero error needle. Then set Event Timer,"" and we'll give you a countdown on that when you get to that step. Over. [Long pause.]";CDR
134512.3;CDR;" Okay. ""When in attitude, ACA out of detent to null needles, and set DET.""";LMP
134518.3;LMP;"Roger. Now, that ... the burn attitude will be coming up on a PAD, but, basically, we're looking for a local horizontal retrograde burn, which means, using a COAS, if you put the horizontal line on the COAS on the horns of the Earth and then roll to place the X-axis in the direction of the Sun, we'll ... that will put us in both burn attitude; and you can check that via the Sun which will be in the AOT detent 2. Should lie right along the cursor at the top. We'll have some more words for you momentarily. I'd like to go on to page 31 if you're ready. Over.";CDR
134581.3;CDR; Okay. I figure I have a handle on the attitude, the way the Earth should look in the COAS, and you're going to give me some words on what the Sun would look like in the AOT. Is that right?;LMP
134594.3;LMP;"That's affirmative, Jim. We haven't got a picture of it yet. It's going to be in the top part of the COAS ... Correction, top part of the AOT at the top of the ... the top of detent 2 and the top part of the AOT, and it should, in attitude, if you're right on the Sun, should split the cursor, though that roll angle is not too critical; if we're in about 10 degrees, we'll be okay. We ... but I think ... we think you should be able to get it better than that. On page 31, under the ""DPS Burn Technique,"" you can scratch the bottom part below the little diagram there since the gimbal is locked. Over. [Pause.]";CDR
134647.3;CDR; Understand scratch the bottom part underneath the diagram because the gimbal is locked.;LMP
134652.3;LMP;"That's affirmative; and, since the gimbal was trimmed out at the big burn yesterday, we should be still through the c.g., and we'd like to make sure that Jack sits in the same place for this burn that he did yesterday. That way, we'll ... you should have no trouble controlling attitude. Now I'm ready to go over to page 32. Over.";CDR
134682.3;CDR; Okay. Let me see if I have that right, now. You want Jack to sit in the same attitude so that the gimbals are the same place so you don't have trouble controlling attitude. I got it.;LMP
134690.3;LMP;"Okay. Now on page 32, top of the page, first line, scratch ""Verb 76."" Third line, ""Mode Control: AGS, Att Hold."" At ""Minus 6 minutes,"" scratch lines 1, 2, and at ""Burn Attitude,"" scratch ""Verb 40 Noun 20."" Scratch lines 2, 3, and 4.

134757.3;CDR; Go ahead.;LMP
134759.3;LMP;"Okay. The caution is after ""400 plus zero"": Do not go out of detent on ACA again. Over. [Long pause.]";CDR
134793.3;CDR;"Okay. After the last ""400 plus zero,"" ""Do not go out of detent with ACA."" Is that correct?";LMP
134798.3;LMP;"That's a Roger, Jim. What happens is, of course, we set ... when you go out of detent, you reset the AGS error needles and you ... and you lose your attitude reference. You establish a new attitude reference, and it might not be the burn attitude since, at this point, we're controlling attitude with the TTCA. Now, picking up with the ""Verb 37, Enter,"" scratch. Scratch everything down to the ""404 plus zero,"" and we want you to perform those AGS steps with 404 down through 470. Over.";CDR

At ... after ""Ignition,"" at plus 1 second, ""Terminate Ullage."" Are you with me? Over. [Long pause.]";CDR
134976.3;CDR;"Okay. At 1 minute, ""Master Arm,"" we scratch. At 35 seconds, scratch the first two lines. ""Manual Ullage"" will start at 9 seconds; we're scratching the blocks at 02 seconds; and the line beneath that, at plus 1 second, we ""Terminate Ullage.""";LMP

135014.3;CDR; Scratch the remainder of the page.;LMP
135018.3;LMP;"Okay. Now, like to verify that under the 35 seconds, minus 35 seconds, the only thing you have remaining is ""Engine Arm to Descent."" Over.";CDR
135030.3;CDR; That's affirm. That's the only thing I have.;LMP
135032.3;LMP;"Okay. Turning to the next page and the last page, Jim, 34. Top of the page, ""Monitor Delta-V<sub>x</sub> via 470."" Scratch next two lines, ""When propellant quantity equals 37"" and the ""Descent Helium Reg."" Scratch ""TTCA commander, reduce to 10 percent."" Now we want you to add a line; ""shut"" ... It's a shutdown criteria, ""shutdown on burn time minus 1 second."" Over. [Long pause.]";CDR
135095.3;CDR;"Okay, ""The shutdown is on burn time minus 1 second."" Let me give you an example. If we have a 30-second burn, we're going to shut down at 29 seconds. Is that correct?";LMP

Null the error needles and trim address 470 to ... What was the value there, Charlie?";LMP
135210.3;LMP;"""0.1 foot per second."" The reason we are shutting down on the burn time is, since the ASA breaker has been out for so long, we're not real confident that our AGS PIPAs are going to be super-sharp.

135399.3;CDR;"Okay. Step 1, ""Attitude Control, three to Pulse""; 2, ""Roll with the TTCA [Garble] pitch is 0 and yaw is 0,"" and I think that will be on the AGS ball.";LMP
135416.3;LMP;"That's affirmative. You broke up there for a minute, Jim. We'll do that on the AGS ball from the burn attitude. We just want you to roll either way 90 degrees, keep pitch 0 and yaw 0.

135656.3;LMP; That's affirmative, Jim. That's the one we gave you last night after the big burn, and we'll use that one as modified by ... by us. This ... we tried this PTC under AGS in the simulator and, of course, no slosh or anything, but it seemed to work pretty good by nulling the rates using the TTCA in pitch and roll and letting the AGS do it in yaw. You null the rates by looking at the error needles and just watching those, and when they don't ... when they stop moving, then you got it within the limits of what we want. Over.;CDR
135700.3;CDR; Okay. And I guess, Charlie, you have no ... Do you have a ATT hold mode in pitch and roll at all in this configuration we're in, or do we have to use the TTCA?;LMP
135712.3;LMP; We feel like we have to use the TTCA. The AGS gains are not too good in pitch and roll in this configuration. It'll hold it in yaw but it won't in pitch and roll. Over.;CDR
135727.3;CDR; Okay.;LMP
135729.3;LMP; And you'll have ... During the burn, of course, you'll be controlling pitch and roll via the error needles with the TTCA also, and it's the little scheme that we've practiced in some of the SIMs. Over.;CDR
135748.3;CDR; Right. Understand. [Pause.];LMP
135757.3;CDR; And, Houston, want to make sure that we allow enough time to get to the proper attitude for the burn so that we can be sure we establish the proper attitude and don't have to rush the burn.;LMP
135771.3;LMP;Roger, Jim. We ...we're looking right now, tentatively, at starting this about 45 minutes before the burn and our sensitivity is ... not too bad on this burn. We can go 30 minutes either way and not affect our Delta-V. Over.;CDR
135791.3;CDR; Okay. Fine. And do you have a handle on just how long the burn will be? In time?;LMP
135797.3;LMP;It's looking like at about 7.8 seconds and about 15 ... Correction, 7.8 feet per second and about 15 seconds. Over.;CDR
135810.3;CDR;In about 18 seconds?;LMP
135812.3;LMP;Negative. 15. One fiver.;CDR
135817.3;CDR; One fiver. Okay.;LMP
135819.3;LMP;And one other point is that we'd like to remind you that this is going to be in blowdown and both Regs B closed but we've got plenty at the 10 per cent.;CDR
135834.3;CDR; Understand.;LMP
135837.3;LMP;And, Jim, in the simulator with our configuration that we, had here, the thing is real stable at 10 percent, so we don't think you'll have to tweak very much at all using tile TTCAs. Over.;CDR

140640.1;CAPCOM; Read you loud and clear, Fred. How do you read?;LMP
140645.1;LMP; Okay [Garble].;CAPCOM
140647.1;CAPCOM; Roger. We were just about to send you up some items of information pertaining to the burn. Are you ready to copy?;LMP
140659.1;LMP; Stand by.;CAPCOM
140661.1;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];LMP
140686.1;LMP; Okay. Go ahead, Vance.;CAPCOM
140689.1;CAPCOM;"Okay, Fred. First of all, preparations for this, starting with contingency checklist, page 24, we would recommend should start at 104:30 GET, and we'll be happy to receive any comments you have on that, though. Second point: when you're in the burn attitude, you should see the Sun at the very top of the AOT. It'll be splitting the cursor, when your cursor's set at zero. One thing to be aware of though, that it'll slip right out of the AOT very easily since it'll be very sensitive to roll and yaw. Understand that's in detent 2, by the way. Next point: the burn is very insensitive to burn time and attitude. In other words, if necessary, we can slip it if there's any problem at all, and attitude isn't too critical. So that brings us to the point that we only have one real burn rule; that is, if ... rate about any axis gets to 10 degrees a second, that's the limit to stop the burn. Next point, after you finish the burn, and before you trim, request that you leave DEDA in address 470 up a while so we can take a look at it, and let us holler when we've seen it, and then proceed on. Over. [Long pause.]";LMP
140820.1;LMP;Okay, Vance. You're saying we should start into the Prep in the contingency book at about 104:30, and I'll talk this over in a minute with Jim and we'll get back with you on it. When in the burn attitude, we should see the Sun right at the top of the AOT, and I assume this is detent number 2. Jim and I'd already been talking about that, and just eyeballing the terminator in the Earth, we figured the Sun at about something like a 70-degree angle ... 65-degree angle, so that'll be right up there. We get one burn rule that says if the rates are greater than 10 degrees per second, shut her down. And, after we trim, you want me to leave 470 up for a while so you all can have a look at it, and you'll tell me when to get rid of it.;CAPCOM
140878.1;CAPCOM;" That's right, Fred. And, if you have any questions at all regarding the alignment, why please let us know. We'll be happy to answer them, like aligning on the Earth, as was described before. Also, you should know that the pitch is the most critical attitude so far as errors are concerned in this burn; but, as I said, it's still not very sensitive. [Pause.]";LMP
140916.1;LMP; Yes, the ... and unfortunately, the way we're looking out the window through the COAS, we can align the yaw and roll pretty well, but it's the ... Sun that has to get us pitch.;CAPCOM
140929.1;CAPCOM;Right. And ... and a correction on this DEDA 470 thing. Request that we let you ... Give you a Go before you trim. Over.;LMP
140943.1;LMP; Say ... Say again, Vance, on that last.;CAPCOM
140946.1;CAPCOM;Roger. We would like to see address 470, and give you a Go before you trim. Over.;LMP
140956.1;LMP;Oh, okay. I ... I see. Okay. After burn, we'll leave 470 up a while and wait for your word to do the trim.;CAPCOM
140964.1;CAPCOM; That's correct. How was the sleep?;LMP
141065.1;LMP; Okay. And ... [Long pause.];CAPCOM
141081.1;LMP; Okay. Vance, are you there?;CAPCOM
141083.1;CAPCOM; Roger. Go ahead.;LMP
141087.1;LMP; Okay. The picture that Jim gave me on his view through the COAS was within the ... the partial Earth, the lit portion laying in the top half of the COAS with the cusp laying right on the Y-Y line. And so the ... The whole dark part of the Earth would be at the bottom part of the Earth, except a very thin crescent of the dark part to a line ... line above the Y-Y line.;CAPCOM
141125.1;CAPCOM; Okay. That is correct.;LMP
141126.1;LMP; And that in essence ... that in ... Yes, that in essence would put our X-axis pointing toward the Sun.;CAPCOM
141133.1;CAPCOM; That's correct. The plus X-axis pointing toward the Sun and perpendicular to the terminator of the Earth. [Pause.];LMP
141144.1;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
141146.1;CAPCOM; Two other points, Fred. One is that we don't expect hardly any misalignment of your engine for the burn, so we don't really expect any rates throughout the length of the burn, especially since it's at very low thrust. Second point, request you verify that your suit temperature rheostat's in Full Cold. That ... if it ... If it were in Full Cold, that might help your cabin temperature situation. It might bring the temperature up.;LMP
141188.1;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
141205.1;LMP; Okay. The latter was a good point. We had it in Full Hot.;CAPCOM
141210.1;CAPCOM; Very good.;LMP

141216.1;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];LMP
141264.1;LMP;Okay, Vance. Is the T<sub>IG</sub> time going to be approximately ... Is it 105 or 105:30?;CAPCOM
141272.1;CAPCOM;It's 105:30.;LMP
141277.1;LMP;Okay. Your 104:30 time to start in is ... sounds pretty good. That'll give us lots of time to get set up with the attitude business, in case we have any trouble stopping PTC and getting there and ... That will give us a little time to be sitting and waiting, all set up.;CAPCOM

143762.7;CDR; First row. Ullage. AGS. [Pause.];LMP
143771.7;CDR; Your AGS on?;LMP
143773.7;LMP; My what? My what? Oh, yes. Go ahead.;CDR
143778.7;CDR; Okay. The four Inverters of this AC Bus volt, Fred.;LMP
143784.7;LMP; Okay. Go ahead. [Pause.];CDR
143792.7;CDR; Okay. Let's ... give the last thing to Jack and I'll keep it all out. Okay? RCS System A. That's in. TCAs are going off. Why do they need the Isol valves in the Ascent Feed in?;LMP
143817.7;LMP; You're not sucking any power unless you take these switches and move them.;CDR
143821.7;CDR; How come we pulled them out, then, in this burn?;LMP
143823.7;LMP; Because you didn't want them to get moved inadvertently, I guess. It doesn't matter, Jim, they can be out or in in terms of powerdown. They just don't count. [Long pause.];CDR
143846.7;CDR;Okay. I got 1, 2, 3. [Pause.];LMP
143854.7;CDR;Isol valve should be in 2.;LMP
143856.7;CDR; Yes. Okay. Third row. Attitude Direct Control I still have in. [Long pause.];LMP
143901.7;LMP; Jack, how do you read now in baseband?;CDR
143904.7;CAPCOM;Reading you 5-square, Fred. How me?;LMP
143908.7;LMP; Okay. I'll stay this mode, if it's all right, so we won't be hot miked. [Pause.];CAPCOM
143916.7;CAPCOM; Roger.;LMP
143929.1;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. You're cleared to open the Power Amplifier circuit breaker and go to Low Bit Rate, leaving the Power Amp switch in Primary.;LMP
143941.1;LMP; Okay. I'll pull the prime S-Band Power Amp breaker and go Low Bit Rate.;CAPCOM
143949.0;LMP; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
143952.0;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;LMP
143958.0;LMP; About how far out are we now, Jack? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
143973.0;CAPCOM;Okay, Aquarius. You're 150,000 miles and you're coming in at 4,500 feet a second. That's from the Earth.;LMP
143985.0;LMP;Okay. We're at 100 ... Yes. 150K, 4,500 feet a second. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
144011.0;CAPCOM; And, Aquarius, how much TTCA control did you have to do in the burn?;LMP
144018.0;LMP; How much ... What was that, Jack?;CAPCOM
144020.0;CAPCOM; How much control of the TTCA did you have to do during the burn?;LMP
144028.0;LMP; I wasn't noticing Jim too much. I'd say I put in maybe about six or seven inputs. I don't think it ever got off more than a couple of needle widths. [Pause.];CAPCOM
144046.0;CAPCOM; Roger, Fred. Thank you. [Pause.];LMP
144055.0;LMP; I think it's probably the same for Jim. I wasn't noticing his input but the ... his needle was hanging in there pretty good.;CAPCOM
144064.0;CAPCOM; Roger. Thank you, Fred.;LMP
144073.2;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?;CMP
144078.2;CMP; I read you loud and clear, Jack.;CAPCOM
144081.2;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. What's your status, who's sleeping, and who's working?;CMP
144088.2;CMP; Well, right now we're all three kind of working. Do you have any recommendations?;CAPCOM
144097.2;CAPCOM;Yes, looks like to us from here that you and Fred ought to get some sleep, and that you ought to eat in about 6 hours. And that the Skipper ought to go to bed about 113 hours.;CMP
144116.2;CMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
144117.2;CAPCOM;I've got some other information. We shouldn't have some good dope on your trajectory for about 2 hours. Looked like to us that the burn was real good, however, and we're taking a close look at it, and we'll get back with you on that in about 2 hours from now. Another thing that we're expecting to have happen is that the SHe tank is going to reach its burst limit. The earliest time we predict this will happen will be at 107 hours on about 25 minutes. And the latest probable time is at 110 hours, and this is supposed to be a nonpropulsive vent, but you might hear it and you might see something.;CMP
144159.2;CMP; Okay. That's good news. We were wondering about that. And I'll relay all the other information you gave me.;CAPCOM
144167.2;CAPCOM;Okay. And if the SHe tank does burst during this time frame before we get trajectory info, why, that will delay our trajectory info somewhat. Your consumables, your rates is now good through 152 hours.;CMP
144185.2;CMP; Jack, wait a minute. Let me copy some of this down.;CAPCOM
144187.2;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];CMP
144201.2;CMP; Okay. I'm ready now.;CAPCOM
144207.2;CAPCOM; Okay. We're predicting that you still have more water than you need. And one thing we'd like for you to do is when you're going to sleep up there in the Command Module take a look through the optics and see if you can see any stars.;CMP
144230.2;CMP; Okay, Jack, I will do. Jim and I were able to spot constellations from the windows of the LM when there's no venting taking place. Could you give me some time on these consumables, what you're predicting they're good for? I think you started to give them times, didn't you, or was I just hearing things.;CAPCOM
144269.2;CAPCOM;We started to give you some times. We think we might be able to give you some better ones pretty soon. But it looks like your water is good through 154 hours, and you've got O<sub>2</sub> through 272 hours, plenty of lithium hydroxide, and your amp-hours ought to be good through 199 or 200 hours. Over. [Pause.];CMP
144307.2;CMP;" Okay; good. Copy that. [Pause.]";CAPCOM
144317.2;CAPCOM;We expect that your water rate is going to drop off and at the time, Delta will go up to 160 - 165 hours quite shortly. Another thing we're interested in is what's your status on rest and medication.;CMP
144336.2;CMP; Okay. None of us, I know of, had any medications, and right now as far as rest, I suppose we're no tireder than normally in this situation. I'm going to relay the work-sleep cycle.;CAPCOM
144353.2;CAPCOM; Okay. And don't forget to look through the optics when you go up in the Command Module. [Pause.];CMP
144363.2;CMP; [Laughter.] Okay. I'll do that.;CAPCOM
144457.2;CMP; Jack, as luck would have it, we just now started to vent a little from the Command Module [Garbled] [Long pause.];CAPCOM
144499.2;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Sorry about that but there's too much background noise to read you. I think we'll have to wait until you come up on a new antenna. Over.;CMP
144511.2;CAPCOM; Okay, Aquarius. Go ahead now. I think can hear you.;CMP
144516.2;CMP; Okay. Okay, Jack. I was going to say, as luck would have it, the Command Module picked this time to start venting again, so I probably won't be able to get a good hack out of stars out of the telescope.;CAPCOM
144533.2;CAPCOM; Okay. Thank you. And if you can think of it, when the time comes up, when you're not venting, how about remembering to take a look through them and give us a word?;CMP
144544.2;CMP; Okay. Will do.;CAPCOM
144561.6;CMP; Houston, Aquarius. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
144581.6;CAPCOM; Go ahead. Over. [Long pause.];CMP
144618.6;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Did you call?;CMP
144622.6;CMP; Yes, Jack. I just got a question. How long are you predicting our Command Module LiOH canisters to last in here?;CAPCOM
144637.6;CAPCOM;Okay, Jack. We've got 14 cartridges that'll last 157 hours, plus we've got the LM primary cartridge with 23 hours, and we've got two PLSS cartridges with 7 hours apiece.;CMP
144652.6;CMP; Okay. I was just curious as to how much time we've got out of these two cartridges.;CAPCOM
144659.6;CAPCOM;Stand by 1. I'll get a prediction on that. By the way, I hope you're keeping track of the ones you've used and the ones you've not.;CMP
144668.6;CMP;Yes, right now, we have numbers 7 and 8 in the LM here.;CAPCOM
144677.6;CAPCOM; Roger.;CMP
144680.6;CMP; They were two brand new fresh ones.;CAPCOM
144689.2;CAPCOM;Aquarius, Houston. In regards to the CO<sub>2</sub> canisters, by the way the PCO<sub>2</sub> is reading 1.6 down here now. We expect that we can get 6 more hours out of the two canisters that we have there - 6 hours at least. However, at 112 hours, when we've got several people up, we're going to rig up two more and we have the new simplified procedure for doing this. However, in the meantime, should we need to have a canister change, we plan to switch to the LM primary canister. Over.;CMP
144728.2;CMP; Okay. Copy that, Jack. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
144744.2;CAPCOM; And, Aquarius, how's your PTC holding up?;CMP
144750.2;CMP; Well, we got a little bit off Jack. The - It starts high in the LMP's window and goes low in the CDR window. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
144773.2;CMP; So we've got a little bit of a wobble on it. Of course, the Command Module venting doesn't help, either.;CAPCOM
144791.7;CMP; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
144793.7;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CMP
144797.7;CMP; Jack, in reference to your question about the PTC, on this last complete revolution, the Sun first appeared in the very top right corner of the LMP window, passed over the CDR window, and was visible through the overhead window, and now the Moon is - came pretty well through the center of both windows this last time. [Pause.];CAPCOM
144827.7;CAPCOM; Okay. Thank you, Jack. Good copying that.;CMP
144843.2;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. We'd like to get a little better idea of how PTC is going. So, what we'd like for you to do is what we did last time. That is to give us a reading on the center of the Earth and the center of the Moon on the - on the LPD.;CMP
144869.2;CMP; On the LPD. Okay, It's shifted. Let's see, the Moon's gone by and the Earth didn't come into the LPD last time. [Pause.];CAPCOM
144883.2;CAPCOM; Okay. But when it goes by the plane of the LPD, tell us where it was. Okay? ;CMP
144890.2;CMP; Okay. Will do.;CAPCOM
144908.7;CMP; Okay, Jack. This pass, the Earth came into view at the top left-handcorner of the LMP's window and was going down. However, when it passed it wasn't as high up as the last pass. It did pass into view at the CDR window, but too high up to get an LPD reading.;CAPCOM
144931.7;CAPCOM; Roger. Understand it went high in both windows then.;CMP
144938.7;CMP;" Yes, last time it wasn't even visible in the CDR's window; this time it was visible if you squatted down, but too high up to get an LPD reading.";CAPCOM
144948.7;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. That's good. Thank you.;CMP
144961.8;CMP;" Okay, Houston; Aquarius.";CAPCOM
144963.8;CDR; Go ahead. Over.;CMP
144967.8;CMP;Okay. The Moon came into view at the middle of the LMP's window, passed through the CDR's window at an LPD of 5 degrees.;CDR
144981.8;CDR; Roger. Understand.;CMP
144990.4;CMP; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
144993.4;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CMP
144997.4;CMP;Okay, Jack. On this pass, the Earth came into the view at the top part of the LMP's window, and we got an LPD angle on it as it passed through the CDR's window of a minus 4 degrees.;CAPCOM
145013.4;CAPCOM;Okay. A minus 4. Thank you, Jack ...;CMP
145014.4;CMP;It's - it's above the - Okay. Are you familiar with the minus 4 being halfway through the sky part, huh?;CAPCOM
145023.4;CAPCOM; Affirmed.;CMP
145030.0;CMP;" Okay, Houston; Aquarius.";CAPCOM
145034.0;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CMP
145038.0;CMP;Okay. On this pass, the Moon came into view at the top part of the LMP's window, came across higher. Jim estimates the LPD angle at a minus 15 degrees.;CAPCOM
145056.0;CAPCOM;Okay. A minus 15 on the Moon, and sounds like it's set up pretty well. [Pause.];CMP
145068.0;CMP; Everybody's happy with it down there? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
145102.0;CAPCOM; Aquarius, it's a little too early to tell exactly how the PTC is going. We'd like to get a few more points, so keep reading them off, and we're still looking for that Supercrit to go anytime. [Long pause.];CMP
145115.0;CMP; Okay.;CDR
145131.2;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
145134.2;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CDR
145138.2;CDR;The Earth was just fairly high in the LMP's window and across the 14 degree LPD line.;CAPCOM
145148.2;CAPCOM;"Okay, Skipper; 14 degrees. Thank you.";CDR
145157.4;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
145159.4;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CDR
145163.4;CDR;The Moon went by the LPD at 6 degrees, plus 6 degrees.;CAPCOM
145168.4;CAPCOM;Okay. The Earth at plus 6. Thank you.;CDR
145174.4;CDR; That's the Moon, the Moon.;CAPCOM
145176.4;CAPCOM; Okay. The Moon. Thank you.;CDR
145180.2;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
145183.2;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CDR
145187.2;CDR;The Moon passed by at a minus 8 degrees on the LPD. No, that's the Earth. The Earth passed by at a minus 8 degrees.;CAPCOM
145198.2;CAPCOM;Okay. The Moon went by at a minus 8 degrees. [Pause.];CDR
145212.2;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim. We got it. The Earth went by at a minus 8 degrees. On a basis of the data ...;CDR
145218.2;CDR; That's right.;CAPCOM
145219.2;CAPCOM;On the basis of the data we have so far, your entry angle is 5.99. The block data we gave you on the PAD for a no-Comm midcourse-7 last night is no longer valid because we made this midcourse. [Long pause.];CDR
145248.2;CDR;Okay. Understand, the no-Comm PAD is no longer valid because of the midcourse. Entry angle based on the last 2 hours' tracking is 5.99, and I take it you're going to keep tracking for some time now to see whether we need another midcourse or not.;CAPCOM
145265.2;CAPCOM; That's affirmative. [Pause.];CDR
145275.2;CDR;Are you planning any no-Comm midcourse at 134 and change anyway right now, or are you going to wait?;CAPCOM
145284.2;CAPCOM; We're discussing that now, Jim, and it looks like we're going to wait on the tracking. For the time being, since you're in the corridor, why, there's no need to pass it up. But we're going to keep looking at the tracking, and we'll probably come up with one.;CDR
145304.2;CDR; All right. I'm not too sure what the venting is going to do to us so - when this SHe tank ruptures, what it's going to do for us.;CAPCOM
145317.2;CAPCOM;Roger. We don't presently expect the SHe tank to have any effect on your trajectory, and the pressure's up to 1921 now. [Pause.];CDR
145329.2;CDR; Hey, it's going a lot better than we ever expected. What a way to get a data point? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
145365.2;CDR; And, Jack, just think. You thought you we're going to sleep through all your watches.;CAPCOM
145371.2;CAPCOM; Say again, Jim. [Pause.];CDR
145378.2;CDR; I said, you thought you were going to sleep through all you watches. [Pause.];CAPCOM
145388.2;CAPCOM; Well, you keep waking me up.;CDR
145394.2;CDR; Sorry about that.;CAPCOM
145407.2;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. You notice anything?;CDR
145413.2;CDR;Yes, Jack. I was just about ready to call you. Underneath quad 4, I noticed a lot of sparklies going out.;CAPCOM
145426.2;CAPCOM; Can you hear or feel anything?;CDR
145430.2;CDR; No, I sure can't, but I think it changed our - it changed out PTC. Let me check and see what the drift is. [Pause.];CAPCOM
145445.2;CAPCOM;Okay. She's going down through 600 now. [Pause.];CDR
145454.2;CDR; I think we're probably going to have to reestablish PTC. Yes, we got pretty fast yaw drifting, Jack. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
145493.2;CDR; Houston, Aquarius. What are your plans?;CAPCOM
145497.2;CAPCOM; We're thinking about them right now. Did you say it yawed some? [Pause.];CDR
145504.2;CDR;" Yes, I was in a right yaw and now I'm in a left, yaw; at a much faster rate than the one we put in PTC. [Pause.]";CAPCOM
145524.2;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. We're talking it over. Stand by. [Long pause.];CDR
145576.2;CDR; What's the SHe tank down to now, Jack?;CAPCOM
145580.2;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim. It's going through 125 pounds now. And we understood you to say...;CDR
145586.2;CDR; Okay;CAPCOM
145587.2;CAPCOM; ...that it reversed your yaw. Is that affirmative?;CDR
145593.2;CDR; Sure did, Jack. It reversed my yaw completely and put in a little pitch, I think. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
145609.2;CDR; But more than anything, it reversed my yaw.;CAPCOM
145612.2;CAPCOM; Roger. Have you effectively established PTC in the opposite direction then?;CDR
145620.2;CDR; Well, you could say that. I'm not too sure just what kind of pitch or roll I've got, coupled with the yaw. I just saw the Earth go by the LMP's window here, not too long ago at a rather faster rate than we had going the other direction. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
145654.2;CDR; Perhaps you can tell how fast I'm having to shift Omnis.;CAPCOM
145658.2;CAPCOM; Yes, we can tell the Comm cycling back and forth. [Pause.];CDR
145668.2;CDR; Is that what they call a nonpropulsive vent?;CAPCOM
145672.2;CAPCOM; Right. I'd hate to see a propulsive one.;CDR
145677.2;CDR; You and me both.;CAPCOM
145680.2;CAPCOM;It's going through 50 pounds now. So, are you seeing fewer sparklies?;CDR
145688.2;CDR; Yes. Much fewer. Not any at all, now. I'm not sure whether that vent gave me reverse yaw and roll - left roll - that's - if that's what it gave me.;CAPCOM
145710.2;CAPCOM; You say you think it might have given you some left roll as opposed to opposite yaw. [Pause.];CDR
145721.2;CDR; I'm sure it gave me the yaw, Jack, but I'm not too sure [Garbled];CAPCOM
145726.2;CAPCOM; Okay. We'd kind of like to watch it, see what happens for a little while before we make a recommendation. However, we'll need some inputs from you on that.;CDR
145738.2;CDR;Well, we're in no trouble up here as far as - as far the yaw goes. Everything's fine. It's faster than we had set up before. We just wanted to get into proper thermal constraint, and it's going to take me 15 minutes to get the thrusters up anyway. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
145794.2;CAPCOM; Okay, Skipper. We don't see any thermal problems as a result of this change. If we see some communications problems, we may have to do something different, but so far, so good. And we'd kind of like to hear from you on LPD numbers, if you get anything going by the window.;CDR
145824.2;CDR; Okay. Will do. [Long pause.];CMP
145859.2;CMP;Okay, Jack. The Earth just went through at an LPD of 26 degrees.;CDR
145865.2;CAPCOM;Okay. The Earth went through at 26 degrees going the opposite direction this time - left to right. Is that right?;CMP
145873.2;CMP; From left to right. That's affirmative. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
145888.2;CAPCOM; Of course, the only other thing that we'd be concerned about is what change in your velocity this might have had and what Delta-V it imparted, and we'll have to look at that for a while before we are able to determine it. And, if there is no significant change, why, we prefer just to leave it the way it is.;CMP
145910.2;CMP; Okay, Jack. We're going to get a time on a revolution here, and maybe that'll help you out.;CAPCOM
145918.2;CAPCOM;Right. And, for your information, the tank went at 1937.;CMP
145927.2;CMP;That's two thousand - 1937?;CAPCOM
145930.2;CAPCOM; Right. [Long pause.];CMP
145988.2;CMP;Okay, Jack. The Earth went through again at 18 degrees on the LPD.;CAPCOM
145995.2;CAPCOM;Okay. Earth at 18. Thank you.;CMP
145999.2;CMP; Okay. And we didn't see the Moon that time.;CAPCOM
146077.2;CMP;Okay, Jack. The Moon went through that time at 32 degrees on the LPD.;CAPCOM
146082.2;CAPCOM;Roger. Moon at 32. Thanks.;CMP
146112.6;CMP;Okay, Jack. Well, we didn't get the Earth that time. The Moon came back through at about 10 degrees, and now we're getting to the Earth again. Stand by. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
146153.6;CMP;Okay. The Earth came through the LPD at 62 degrees that time. And the total time for the two revolutions, - I missed the Earth revolution before, but the total time for the Earth's two revolutions was 3 minutes and 50 seconds. [Pause.];CAPCOM
146178.6;CAPCOM; Say again the time and the - and also the LPD number. You're in the background noise, Jack.;CMP
146184.6;CMP;Okay. Okay, Jack. LPD that time was 62 degrees and that was for two revolutions, being at that distance we missed the Earth - The time before we didn't see it. And the time was 3 minutes and 50 seconds.;CAPCOM
146204.6;CAPCOM;Okay. Three minutes and 50 seconds. Is that rate uncomfortable for you? [Long pause.];CMP
146239.6;CMP; Jack, Jim said it isn't uncomfortable. It's a little annoying as for the Omni switching, and also he said it's kind of - He said this Earth/Moon relationship's kind of [Garbled] because he doesn't know when to [Garbled];CAPCOM
146255.6;CAPCOM; Roger.;CMP
146276.0;CMP; Okay, Jack. We've got a Master Alarm and we've got a battery light flickering.;LMP
146282.0;CAPCOM; Okay. Copy a battery light. What battery? [Long pause.];LMP
146322.0;CAPCOM; Aquarius, how about cycling the power temp monitor to find out which battery it is, please.;LMP
146331.0;LMP; Yes. That's in work, Joe. [Pause.];CAPCOM
146345.0;LMP; Okay. It's that same old [Garbled]. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
146360.0;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. I can hear you now. Say again, please.;LMP
146367.0;LMP;Okay. It's the same old - same old one. The only light I'm getting is on Bat 2. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
146401.0;CAPCOM;Okay, Fred. We copy - copy your same old friend, battery 2. Could you give us high bit rate for a while, please? [Long pause.];LMP
146439.0;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. High bit rate, please.;LMP
146445.0;LMP; How you getting it now, Jack?;CAPCOM
146465.0;CAPCOM; We got it.;LMP
146736.0;CAPCOM;"Okay, Aquarius. You can go low bit rate, Power Amp, Off and Down Voice Backup now. Voltages and currents look normal on battery 2; so ignore the battery light.";LMP
146754.0;LMP; Okay, Jack. Power Amp, Off, back to low bit rate, and I'll go back to sleep.;CAPCOM
146763.0;CAPCOM; The battery light staying on? [Pause.];LMP
146772.0;LMP;Yeeah. We got a steady on Bat 2, Bat Fault Light and the battery caution light. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
146791.0;CAPCOM; Okay. And is the Skipper in the sack now?;LMP
146798.0;LMP; Aah - say again?;CAPCOM
146799.0;CAPCOM; Is the Skipper in the sack now? [Pause.];LMP
146810.0;LMP; Okay. Hold on a minute, Jack.;CAPCOM
146819.4;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;CDR
146824.4;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
146826.4;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. Since the antenna switch is kind of annoying, we've talked them into buying only half of the data. If it gets too troublesome for you to switch antennas, why, just leave it on one antenna and we'll listen to you half of the time.;CDR
146845.4;CDR; Okay. It's not really much trouble. That's all we're doing about it. We'll try to keep up with it. And you're satisfied with this attitude so far. I guess you're going to watch the thermal and find out whether perhaps we're going to some other PTC attitude.;CAPCOM
146857.4;CAPCOM; Roger. Thermal appears to be no problem. We're looking at what Delta-V might have been imparted due to this, and it looks like we're not going to change the PTC attitude.;CDR
146876.4;CDR;" Okay. Then Delta-V was a part of it; I hope it raised that angle a little bit. [Long pause.]";CAPCOM
146906.4;CAPCOM;Yes. We'll be looking at the data here, and give you a better answer in next 30 minutes or so.;CDR
146914.4;CDR; Okay. Meanwhile, back to the drawing board about nonpropulsive vents. [Pause.];CAPCOM
146928.4;CAPCOM; And, with your kind of luck, it probably lowered the angle some more.;CDR
146935.4;CDR; Thanks for the confidence. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
146965.4;CAPCOM;And, Jim, we're going to have a handover here pretty soon, about 3 minutes, we may lose uplink for 30 seconds or a minute.;CDR
146976.4;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
146990.4;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. We're handed over. How do you read?;CDR
146996.4;CDR; Read you loud and clear, Jack.;CAPCOM
147002.4;CAPCOM; Okay. I'm hearing you now, and the noise has come up again, but it will go down. [Pause.];CDR
147012.4;CDR; How do you read now?;CAPCOM
147013.4;CAPCOM; Okay. That's a lot better, and we figure your battery glitch was just that thermal switch triggered a mal - a Caution and Warning, just cycled once, and triggered a Master Alarm again. We'll watch the batteries for you, since you don't have any Caution and Warning on now.;CDR
147033.4;CDR; Okay. Appreciate. that.;CAPCOM
147042.0;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim. Your luck is holding. Tracking shows that your entry angle has gone up to minus 6.24. This is on the basis of all the data we've collected between the midcourse up to the time the SHe tank went. So, we'll continue to look at it, and see if SHe tank did anything to it at all. So it's - The data has gone from 5.9 to a minus 6.24.;CDR
147076.0;CDR; That sounds pretty good. We're really getting in there.;CAPCOM
147090.7;CAPCOM; How are you doing, Jim?;CDR
147096.7;CDR; Not bad. Not bad at all. [Pause.];CAPCOM
147107.7;CAPCOM; Is Jack in the sack, or is he with you?;CDR
147113.7;CDR;" Jack and Fred both are going to sleep. It's sort of humorous; Fred's sleeping place now is in the tunnel, upside down with his head resting on the ascent engine. Jack is on the floor of the LM, with a restraint [Garbled] wrapped around his arm to keep him down there.";CAPCOM
147136.7;CAPCOM; You say Jack is on the floor, and Fred is with his head on the ascent engine.;CDR
147143.7;CDR; That's right, with his feet up into the tunnel.;CAPCOM
147154.3;CAPCOM;Okay, Skipper. Your luck is really hanging in there. Your water's good up to 161 hours now.;CDR
147162.3;CDR; Hey, that sounds great. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
147176.3;CAPCOM; That doesn't include PLSS water or Command Module water. [Pause.];CDR
147185.3;CDR; Okay. Jack, I'd just like to know what - what plans or thoughts being contemplated for the PLSSs or the OPS, whether we're going to use their LiOH canisters or take the devices back in the Command Module with us, or just what will be your plans.;CAPCOM
147211.3;CAPCOM; Yes. We're talking all that over now. We haven't decided. [Pause.];CDR
147224.8;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
147560.8;CAPCOM; Everything's running real smooth over in Timber Cove, Jim.;CDR
147567.8;CDR; Sounds pretty good. How about at El Lago?;CAPCOM
147573.8;CAPCOM; Same. Everything's smooth there, too.;CDR
147578.8;CDR; Good.;CAPCOM
147652.3;CAPCOM; Jim, we've had a lot of people working on the entry procedures, and they'll be continuing to do so. We got a few ideas we'd like to toss at you so you can start thinking about them if you think you're in a position to discuss them without waking up the other guys. What do you think? [Long pause.];CDR
147669.3;CDR; Yes, go ahead. It's okay.;CAPCOM
147673.3;CAPCOM;"One of the first things we want to do is charge the battery in CSM, so we can get some LM power over there to do that, and we have procedures ginned up to do it. In regards to reentry, we're planning our last midcourse at 5 hours before Entry Interface, and, if we have to make one, that is. And then we'd like to jettison the Service Module at 4 hours and a half, roughly, before Entry Interface, and take the next 3 to 3Â½ hours for taking pictures, cranking up the Command Module G&amp;N, taking care of stowage, and other odds and ends. And we'd hang on to the LM until 1 hour before Entry Interface, and then we'd jettison that. And these procedures are going to be run integrated in the CMS and LMS tomorrow morning, and, hopefully, later on in the day, we'll do it again with Mission Control on the loop. A couple of other things we'd like to toss at you: one question is what do we do with the OPS. The thought is that there is adequate O<sub>2</sub> in the Command Module and that the OPS represents high pressure source and a stowage problem, and people are thinking about leaving them in the LM. The other thing is that we think you might want to make this a suited entry, suiting up prior to LM jettison, because what we're doing is, when we jettison the LM, we're going to do it like we did in Apollo 10 ... just let the beauty go, and if we weren't suited, why, we'd be betting on the hatch seal to take care of us. So we thought we'd toss these few ideas at you. Some of them are ones that are particularly pertinent questions at this time. [Pause.]";CDR
147799.3;CDR;Okay. A suited entry would sort of [garble] the 1-hour LM jettison back and [garble] back and forth up to that time. [Garble] impede our progress back and forth. [Garble] [Pause.];CAPCOM
147823.3;CAPCOM; We're losing you, Jim.;CDR
147826.3;CDR;Okay. I think I've got you back. I guess the midcourse at 5 hours prior to [garble];CAPCOM
147838.3;CAPCOM;Affirmative, Jim. Midcourse 5 hours prior to Entry Interface. [Pause.];CDR
147848.3;CDR; If that's the case, all I'm worried about is having that all squared away. It's long before that [garble] I want everything in its place. All the stowage cleared away, all the [garble] ready to go and know exactly what to do and [garble] so that we can do the midcourse, and [garble] get into the Command Module [garble] jettison the Service Module, and then know exactly how to get into the LM.;CAPCOM
147886.3;CAPCOM; Roger. All those procedures will work - will be worked out precisely, and we agree that the stowage and all of those peripheral details ought to be taken care of before midcourse. [Pause.];CDR
147904.3;CDR; And, I guess, that last midcourse, we'd want to start looking at midcourse fairly early, if we have the power to do so, mainly because of attitude control. This last time was fairly easy, but I'm not too sure how long we can continue to [garble]. I have the confidence that if everything is under control as it is now, we'll probably be going long before entry. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
147942.3;CDR; I have [garble] in, and it seems about as cold as it is now, we'll probably be going into suits long before entry. [Pause.];CAPCOM
147955.3;CAPCOM; Yes. That's what we were thinking. [Long pause.];CDR
147983.3;CAPCOM; I guess the two things which are somewhat unresolved at the moment are what to do with the OPS and what to do about the suited entry. We thought we'd toss those at you to see what you thought about them.;CDR
147999.3;CDR; Okay. As far as the OPS is concerned, we have enough oxygen in the spacecraft [garble] to get us through. I have no [garble] Command Module [garble] suit loop prior to entry. I was looking at [garble] OPS [garble] sources of oxygen [garble] also in the - in the front of the suit loop or [garble] circulate [garble] [Long pause.];CAPCOM
148059.3;CAPCOM; Jim, I'm sorry. We're not catching what you're saying. The comm is getting kind of bad right now.;CDR
148068.3;CDR; Okay, Jack. How do you read now?;CAPCOM
148071.3;CAPCOM; I've still got you with quite a bit of background noise, but if you talk up like that, I think we can hear you.;CDR
148079.3;CDR; Okay. My only concern about leaving the OPS and/or the PLSS in the Command Module is how soon do we have to live off the Command Module consumables prior to entry, and the PLSS has a fan and has a lithium hydroxide [garble] use the Command Module system. Also, the OPS [garble] right now [garble] Command Module [garble] Command Module oxygen and electrical power is [garble] but I had just as soon be [garble] back in the LM.;CAPCOM
148123.3;CAPCOM; It sounds like the general gist of your comments are that if things remain pretty much as they are now in the Command Module, you'd just as soon leave the OPS in the LM. Is that affirm?;CDR
148137.3;CDR; That's affirm. [Pause.];CAPCOM
148144.3;CAPCOM; Okay. And maybe you'd like to think over the suited entry bit a little while. [Pause.];CDR
148153.3;CDR; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
148174.3;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
148175.3;CAPCOM; Go ahead.;CDR
148179.3;CDR; Okay [garble]. How we align the Command Module right for entry, especially if you have the LM in back. Over.;CAPCOM
148194.3;CAPCOM; Roger. That's one subject that's been getting a lot of attention, and let me see if I can get some general ideas on that at the moment. [Pause.];CDR
148206.3;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
148216.9;CAPCOM;"Jim, I can give you the general idea of the proposed procedure for bringing the Command Module G&amp;N up. It's the presently proposed one. We may come up with a better one, but there's what we're looking at right now. First thing we plan to do is to - using the LM COAS, sight on the Earth with the LM just as we did in the midcourse. Then we'll do a body-axis align, 400 plus 5 on the AGS, to put the AGS ball at 000. And then we can give you an AGS ball attitude to fly to, to point the CSM optics at the Moon. And, if you can see stars, why, we can use those too. Then we can give you an equivalent set of CDU angles to put into NOUN 20 and to torque the platform over. So, now we're coarse aligned. Then we do a fine align by shooting at the Moon and then at the Sun. Do you follow all that? [Long pause.]";CDR
148305.9;CDR;Okay, Jack. Let me see if I have it. What we do is point the LM at the Earth as we did for the midcourse COAS, and we do a body-axis aline on the AGS. Then you give us an AGS ball attitude to fly to. [Garble] the LM, and then we [garble] point the [garble] at the Moon. Then you would update the - give us some CDUs to coarse align. [Garble] fine align [garble] on stars or the Moon or the Earth. Stand by. Okay. We had another Master Alarm, Jack. I don't see any lights down there, except the battery light's still there. You want - [garble] ECS display . Okay. And the number 2 battery still has a light on it. I suspect it may be the same problem that we had before [garble]. [Garble].;CAPCOM
148390.9;CAPCOM; Okay. Let us talk it over a second, and we'll tell you what to do. [Long pause.];CDR
148420.9;CAPCOM; Jim, is the battery light kind of flickering?;CDR
148426.9;CDR; Yes. That's affirm, Jack. [Pause.];CAPCOM
148436.9;CDR; Yes. The battery light's flickering, and it triggers off the Master Alarm.;CAPCOM
148441.9;CAPCOM;Okay. Well, that ... temperature sensor on battery 2 is kind of cycling back and forth and every time it does, it triggers a Master Alarm, Jim.;CDR
148457.9;CDR; Okay. Same old problem, huh?;CAPCOM
148459.9;CAPCOM; Yes. [Long pause.];CDR
148493.9;CAPCOM;And, Jim, finally on the P52, we're considering using the ... the Moon and then the Sun for the fine align.;CDR
148504.9;CDR; Okay. The Moon and the Sun for the fine align. Understand. We'll go through this again here [garble]. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
148535.9;CDR; Okay, Jack. Once ... Once I get the spacecraft at the proper attitude [garble]. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
148562.9;CAPCOM; Jim, I didn't copy your last question due to background noise. [Pause.];CDR
148569.9;CDR; Okay. Once ... Once you get the AGS ball aligned [garble] Command Module [garble]. [Pause.];CAPCOM
148589.9;CAPCOM;After we do the body axis align on the AGS, we can tell you what attitude on the AGS ball to fly to in order to point the CSM optics at the Moon or at some star. And then we can, knowing where the optics are pointed, give you an equivalent set of CDU angles to put in Noun 20 to torque the platform.;CDR
148622.9;CDR; Okay. I see. [Pause.];CAPCOM
148630.9;CAPCOM; That's the current thinking. It may change between now and tomorrow, but right now, that's the way it looks, Jim. It'll probably be some take-off on that anyway.;CDR
148643.9;CDR;" Okay. Are they planning on a G&amp;N entry or using another system, like EMS or something like that?";CAPCOM
148654.9;CAPCOM;" It will be a G&amp;N entry.";CDR
148661.9;CDR; Nothing like going first class.;CAPCOM
148666.9;CAPCOM; Yes. That'll be a switch, won't it?;CDR
148675.7;CAPCOM; Jim, are you broken into the food locker in the LM yet?;CDR
148681.7;CDR; That's affirm, Jack. I sure have. I just put a meal away.;CAPCOM
148689.7;CAPCOM; You say you did find everything in order in there, huh?;CDR
148695.7;CDR; Yes, everything was great.;CAPCOM
148697.7;CAPCOM; Okay. I'll pass it. [Long pause.];CDR
148715.7;CAPCOM; I had a question about that earlier.;CDR
148721.7;CDR; Right.;CAPCOM
148808.7;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
148811.7;CAPCOM; Go ahead.;CDR
148814.7;CDR; I understand that one of your reasons for a suited entry is the fact that the Command Module hatch [garble] hasn't been good. It doesn't seem to be any different, but in the other [garble] our hatch is no better than other spacecraft. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
148853.7;CAPCOM;"No, the situation, Jim, is that your hatch is as good as any other hatch but that we won't have a chance to verify it until so late in the game, like 1 hour before Entry Interface, in this case; whereas before, why, we had a chance to evaluate it in lunar orbit. Over.";CDR
148878.7;CDR; Oh, okay.;CAPCOM
148882.7;CAPCOM;" And that might make your time line a little too crowded, getting your suits on there at the last minute; say, less than an hour before Entry Interface. [Pause.]";CDR
148899.7;CDR; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
148945.7;CAPCOM; Jim, the next action item we want to pursue is transferring some LM power up to the Command Module Main B so we can start charging battery, and I guess what we ought to do is start on that one when somebody else gets up to help you there. So, when you decide to get the other guys up, or to have someone help, why, let us know and we'll start working on that.;CDR
148978.7;CDR; Okay. I'll let you have Jack, and Fred's [garble]. When in the time line [garble]? [Pause.];CAPCOM
148993.7;CAPCOM; Say again, Jimm. I did't catch that.;CDR
148998.7;CDR; When in our time ... What's the GET do you plan on [garble]. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
149042.7;CAPCOM;Jim, I didn't catch all of what you said, but I think you wanted to know when the procedure for entry are going to be available and read up to you. If that's the case, why, we're talking about 120 hours or so. As far as the ... charging battery A, we want to do that as soon as the other guys get up to help you. We've already passed up some of that procedure, and we have a couple of Deltas to it.;CDR
149072.7;CDR; Roger. Jack's already up. He asked [garble] curious when you want to do it. Did you understand that? [Garble]. Is that correct? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
149095.7;CAPCOM; Jim, we're having trouble hearing you. The next order of business is to charge battery A, and when you get somebody to help you there, why, we'll go ahead and get done with it.;CDR
149108.7;CDR; Okay. Sounds good.;CAPCOM
149112.7;CAPCOM; And, before you start working on it let us know, because we've got some Deltas to the battery charging procedure.;CDR
149121.7;CDR; Roger. I'm putting Jack on the line now to copy down the Deltas [garble]. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
149149.7;CMP; Okay, Jack. Go ahead. [Pause.];CAPCOM
149157.7;CAPCOM; Aquarius, did you call?;CMP
149161.7;CMP; Yes, Jack. I'm on the line. [Garble] [Pause.];CAPCOM
149172.7;CAPCOM; Okay. Go ahead now. I can hear better.;CMP
149177.7;CMP; Okay, Jack. Joe Kerwin passed me up the procedure for powering the CSM from the LM. Has it changed? ;CAPCOM
149187.7;CAPCOM; Yes. If you'll get that out, I'll read you the Deltas. [Pause.];CMP

149319.7;CAPCOM;Okay. That part's all right, Jack. And we had ... about 11 or 12 steps for the Command Module. They go as is with no change. And then we had a couple of more procedures for the LM. Stand by 1.;CMP
149347.7;CMP; Okay. Jack, let me read you Command Module procedures just to make sure I have them right, also.;CAPCOM
149353.7;CAPCOM; Okay. Go ahead with the Command Module procedures.;CMP
149358.7;CMP;Okay. Connect LM and CSM umbilicals. Step 2, panel 5: LM Power 1 AC and 2 AC, closed, circuit breakers. Step 3, panel 5: EPS Sensor Signal, Main B, closed. Step 4, panel [garble] Power Entry/Postlanding closed. Then there's step 5: Main B Bat Bus B, closed. Verify Main Bus voltage, then switch the LM power to CSM. Step 7: CB Main B Bat Bus B, open.

149475.7;CMP;Okay. I didn't get the notes, but I'll read you the steps as I have them now. One step, Bat 1, 2, 3, and 4 [garble] and at this point should have Batteries 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 On. Is that affirmative?;CAPCOM
149494.7;CAPCOM;That's affirmative. So now we have Bat 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, On, and I got two notes.

Number 2 note is: now the umbilical between the LM and the Command Module is hot. And the Main Bus voltage can be monitored by selecting Main B. [Long pause.];CMP
149561.7;CMP;Okay, Jack. These notes are: circuit breaker protection limits current to 15 amps. The tube, the umbilical between the CSM and LM is hot. I can monitor Main B for the bus voltage.;CAPCOM
149579.7;CAPCOM; That's affirm, Jack. [Long pause.];CMP
149597.7;CMP; Okay, Jack. One question here. If we transfer power like this, we're not going to cut us short on power remaining in the CSM [garble], are we [garble]?;CAPCOM
149612.7;CAPCOM; Say it again, Jack. I didn't get it.;CMP
149618.7;CMP; Okay. Stand by. If we configure the CSM for powering up the LM, we aren't going to cut it short on LM power requirements to get us back in the Entry Interface, are we?;CAPCOM
149638.7;CAPCOM;That's a negative, Jack. According to the latest update, we've got ampere-hours out to 203 hours. [Long pause.];CMP
149655.7;CMP; Stand by. [Garble] [Long pause.];CAPCOM
149675.7;CMP; Okay, Jack. One question from Jim is, he wants to know whether the procedure has been tried [garble]. [Pause.];CAPCOM
149699.7;CAPCOM; Okay. Try it again, now, Jack. What did Jim want to know?;CMP
149705.7;CMP;" Okay. He would like to know whether the procedure has been tried and whether it has been found to be okay; and there's no danger of shorting out any of our batteries or anything we have on board the LM now. [Long pause.]";CAPCOM
149775.7;CAPCOM;" Okay, Jack. This procedure has not been tried out as such; however, the hardware paths through which the current flows are the same ones which we used during translunar trajectory, and there's not a problem with shorting out a descent battery. Over. [Pause.]";CMP
149802.7;CMP;Jack, of course, the reason for all of this is that we see we're 20 amp-hours short on one of the entry batteries, and we've got to juice that up to get you home with.;CAPCOM
149824.7;CAPCOM; Okay.;CMP
149840.7;CMP; Okay. Now, what we owe you from here on out is the actual battery A charge procedure, and then a procedure to turn this all around, again. [Pause.];CAPCOM

149863.7;CMP;Okay, Jack. I have the procedure in front of me. It's about 18 steps, and the reason it's so long is because we're starting from this basic configuration which we gave you earlier.

150237.7;CMP; Okay. I'm reading you real good now, and I want to verify that the main bus tie that we switched Off was Bat Alpha Charlie.;CAPCOM
150238.7;CAPCOM;" That's verified; Main Bus Tie, Bat Alpha Charlie, Off. And that should [garble].";CMP
150250.7;CMP;Okey. And in panel 3, I've got a switch for you. AC Inverter 2 to Main B. [Pause.];CAPCOM
150257.7;CAPCOM;Okay. AC Inverter 2 to Main B.;CMP
150274.7;CMP;"Okay. And switch Inverter 2, AC Bus 2 to on; and another switch, AC Bus 2 Reset, to reset and center; switch Battery Charge to Alpha; switch DC Indicator select Bat Charger, and then what we want you to do is to report the charger current and voltage to MSFN every l0 minutes for the first half hour, and then once every 30 minutes after that. And that'll be on our call, Jack. Read back the switches that I just gave you. [Long pause.]";CAPCOM
150277.7;CAPCOM;"Okay, Jack. It's panel 3, AC Inverter 2, Main B; Inverter 2, AC Bus 2, on; AC Bus 2 Reset to reset and center, Bat Charger to A, AC Indicator select to Bat Charger. Report amps and volts to MSFN every 10 minutes for the first 30 minutes, and then every 30 minutes on a MSFN call.";CMP
150353.7;CMP; Okay. That's a good readback, Jack. Now the only thing we owe you is a turnaround from this, which we will have.;CAPCOM
150384.7;CAPCOM; Okay. Let me ask one question, here. About how long do you think it'll take to charge these batteries?;CMP
150395.7;CMP;It's going to take you about 15 hours. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
150400.7;CAPCOM;Jack, about how many amperes of LM power will this 15 hours [garble]? [Pause.];CMP
150424.7;CMP; Stand by. We'll get it for you ...;CAPCOM
150436.7;CAPCOM; How many, Jack?;CMP
150437.7;CMP; Okay. He got it. He got the question. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
150441.7;CMP;Okay, Jack. That's going to take 120 amp-hours out of the LM, which is equivalent to 10 hours, which will put us back to 193 hours, and that's plenty.;CAPCOM
150464.7;CAPCOM;Okay. Let me relay that to Jim here. It'll be 120 amp-hours, which leaves us ... which puts us back from 203 hours [garble] to 193 hours.;CMP
150482.7;CMP; Yes, there's that much to spare. [Pause.];CAPCOM
150495.7;LMP; Okay, Jack. One question here. If we have any problem setting up this LM power to the CSM, is the quickest way to get out of it, return to the normal configuration, as it is for me to just switch the LM Power to CSM to Reset then Off? [Pause.];CMP
150510.7;LMP;Stand by 1.;CMP
150532.7;CAPCOM; I would like to give one quick step in case that gave Jim report some sort of problem for us to get out of it quickly.;CMP
150537.7;CMP; Okay. Let us talk it over for a minute, Jack.;CAPCOM
150546.7;CAPCOM; Okay. Real fine. And while you guys are talking it over, you might read back ... Have you got the procedure for reversing this? I'll copy that.;CMP
150559.5;CMP; Okay, Jack. Are you with me?;CAPCOM
150723.5;CMP;"Yes. We're still here, Jack. What we want to do is follow you through on this, so we're going to get high bit rate to do it. In answer to your question, to undo this procedure quickly, in the event a problem develops, be sure that you don't touch the LM Power switch because it's got a Reset position. But the way to undo it; is go into the CSM and on panel 5 open two circuit breakers. And they're some of the first ones we read to you. Open LM Power-1 Main B, and open LM Power-2 Main B. You copy that?";CAPCOM
150726.5;CAPCOM;"Okay. Understand. If I want to get out of this real quickly, I have to open just two circuit breakers in the CSM; that's on panel 5, LM Power-1 Main B, LM Power-2 Main B.";CMP
150768.5;CMP;Okay. And before you go ahead with this, let's establish high bit rate and wait 1 on that. And then as we go through the procedure we want you to wait when you get power on Main B so we can take a look at Main B without any loads on it before we start charging the batteries. [Pause.];CAPCOM
150781.5;CAPCOM; Okay. I understand you want high bit rate on the LM or CSM just before we start this?;CMP
150814.5;CMP; That will be high bit rate on the LM, and stand by for it.;CAPCOM
150823.5;CAPCOM; Okay. [Pause.];CMP
150828.5;CMP; Okay, Jack. Before we go ahead with this, what we want to do is read you the reverse ... the normal reverse procedure.;CAPCOM
150835.5;CAPCOM; Okay. I'm ready to copy. [Long pause.];CMP
150843.5;CMP; Okay, Jack. I got the start on how you reverse this procedure. Ready to copy?;CAPCOM
150899.5;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Jack.;CMP
150907.5;CMP;"Okay. First you want to reverse the battery charge procedure. To do that, on panel 3, switch Battery Charge, Off; AC Inverter 2, Off; panel 5, Main Bus Tie Bat Alpha Charlie, On, up; panel 250, circuit breaker Bat Alpha, Power Entry, and Postlanding, Open. Read back. [Long pause.]";CAPCOM
150909.5;CAPCOM;"Okay, Jack. On panel 3, Battery Charger, Off, AC Inverter 2, Off; on panel 5, Main Bus Tie Alpha Charlie, On; panel 250, CB Bat A, Power Entry and Postlanding, Open.";CMP
150962.5;CMP;That's affirmative, Jack, and then if you'll go back to the rest of the circuit breakers on that list, and just opposite ... Open them all up. Stand by 1. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
150986.5;CAPCOM;"Okay, Jack. Go back to the battery charge procedure I gave you. And, in order to terminate charge, just ... You'll just have to write ""Open"" or ""Off"" next to the circuit switch that I gave you. So on panel 250, that circuit breaker you've already opened; on panel 275, Inverter Power-2 Main B, open; panel 5, Bat Relay Bus Bat A, open; EPS Sensor Unit AC Bus 2, open, EPS Sensor Signal AC2, open; Battery Charger, Main B, open; Battery Charger AC Power, open; Battery Charger, Bat A Charge, open; Inverter Control 2, open; Inverter Control 3, open; you've already done the Main Bus Tie; and then Bat Charge switch to AC 1. Over on panel 3, you have already set the AC Inverter 2 to Off and then Inverter 2 AC Bus 2, Off; AC Bus 2 Reset to Off. You have already put the Battery Charger switch to Off; and your DC Indicator select to Main B. Over. [Pause.]";CMP
151015.5;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. Do you want me to read it back to you?;CMP
151129.5;CMP; No, if you've got something in the right-hand column for all of those, we don't want to have to do it. And now one more thing I owe you is how to untransfer LM power to the CSM, and I'll get that for you in a jiffy.;CAPCOM
151134.5;CAPCOM; Okay. I'll be standing by to copy it.;CMP
151165.5;CMP; Okay. We have a last minute change to that.;CAPCOM
151206.1;CAPCOM;Houston, 13. [Pause.];CMP
151504.1;CMP; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
151553.1;CMP; Okay, Jack. One thing ... I guess you probably all have considered it, but what heavy things can we store down there where the SRCs normally go to help increase our L over D?;CAPCOM
151564.1;CAPCOM; I understand the question is what kind of heavy things can you store where the SRCs go.;CMP
151568.1;CMP; Yes. They go down in the LEB underneath the computer, and the heavier things you have down there increases the L over D. We don't have any SRCs, so I was just wondering what heavy things ... We could probably put some cameras, television cameras, things like that that normally pretty heavy down there in ... that, in our SRC. No, we can't, put the in our SRC, but we could put them in that container down there which would help decrease our L over D. Anything else you can think of would be greatly appreciated because we don't even have a throw away station, so we're down a little bit in L over D.;CAPCOM
151584.1;CAPCOM; Okay. Let me pass that question along, and get somebody working on it. [Long pause.];CMP
151591.1;CMP; Souvenirs, I guess.;CAPCOM
151634.1;CAPCOM; What souvenirs? [Laughter.] All I've got is a Marine Corps foxhole-digging shovel.;CMP
151664.1;CAPCOM; You've got all you need then, buddy. [Pause.];CMP
151670.1;CMP; Okay. Ready to copy the power removal from the Command Module/LM umbilical.;CAPCOM
151680.1;CAPCOM; I'm ready to copy. Go ahead.;CMP
151688.1;CAPCOM;"Okay. This assumes that all the descent batteries are on line and Ascent Battery 6 is on Normal Feed, as we said earlier. First thing you do is go in the CSM and look on panel 5 circuit breaker. LM Power-2 Main B, open; LM Power-1 Main A, open; circuit breaker EPS Sensor Signal Main B, open.";CMP
151696.1;CMP; Hey, Jack.;CAPCOM
151701.1;CAPCOM; Go ahead. [Pause.];CMP
151739.1;CMP; [Garble]. You got just a little bit scratchy there because of the antenna problem. Let me read this back to you. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
151741.1;CAPCOM;Okay. What I got, Jack, was the procedure assumes that all Descent Batteries are On, and Bat 6 is on Normal Feed. Now we're going into the LM and on panel 5, we take LM, or CB LM Power-2, Main B, open. And that's as far as I got.;CMP
151752.1;CMP;"Okay, the second one is on panel 5 also. Circuit breaker, LM Power-1, Main A, open; circuit breaker EPS Sensor Signal, Main B, open. Okay, read those back for the CSM, and I'll give you some steps in the LM. [Pause.]";CAPCOM
151774.1;CMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
151799.1;CAPCOM;"Okay. CB LM Power-2, Main B, open; CB LM Power-1, Main A, open; CB EPS Sensor Signal, Main B, open. Stand by 1, Jack. [Pause.]";CMP
151821.1;CMP;Jack, I don't think we ever closed CB LM Power-1, Main A. We closed LM Power-2, Main B, and LM Power-1, Main B. Both of them on Main B. [Pause.];CAPCOM
151839.1;CMP; Yes, you're right. Both of them should be Main B.;CAPCOM
151856.1;CMP; Okay. Copy that.;CAPCOM
151877.1;CAPCOM; Okay. Ready to copy the LM?;CMP
151883.1;CMP; Okay. Go ahead.;CAPCOM
151888.1;CAPCOM;"Okay. On panel 16 circuit breaker, EPS, Bat Feed Ties, two, open; and now you've got to listen real carefully for high volts and low volts, Battery 1, High Volts, to Off/Reset; Battery 2, Low Volts, to Off/Reset and then On: Battery 2, High Volts, to Off/Reset and then On; Battery 1, High Volts, On; and then the circuit breaker on panel 16, EPS: Bat Feed Ties, both of them, closed. Read back. [Pause.]";CMP
151893.1;CMP;"Okay. On the LM side of the house is on panel 16. CB EPS Bat Feed Ties, two, open; Battery 1, High Voltage, Off/Reset; Battery 2, Low Voltage, Off/ Reset then On; Battery 2, High Voltage, Off/Reset then On; Battery 1, High Voltage, On. Panel 16, CB Bat Feed Ties, two, closed.";CAPCOM
151896.1;CAPCOM; Okay. That's a good readback. It concludes the procedure going both ways and now we just have to stand by.;CMP
151981.1;CMP; Okay, when do you plan to start this?;CAPCOM
152017.1;CAPCOM; Darn soon.;CMP
152027.1;CMP; Did you say not soon?;CAPCOM
152031.1;CAPCOM; No, we're going to do it pretty soon, but we want to have high bit rate, and we don't want you to give that to us until we tell you.;CMP
152036.1;CMP; Okay. I think I'll go back and try to undamp up there. Do you have anything more for the Command Module?;CAPCOM
152038.1;CAPCOM; We're discussing two items, but we don't have them ready right now. [Pause.];CMP
152050.1;CMP; One of them, I hope, is a foolproof alignment procedure. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
152064.1;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. Just for curiosity's sake, does FIDO have any information as to whether that helium ... that SHe tank dump affected our trajectory at all? [Long pause.];CMP
152077.1;CMP;Okay, Aquarius. Our tracking data shows that since the helium dump, our entry angle has not changed from its value of 6.24, and somebody calculated that if we had a propulsive vent, that helium could roughly, at the maximum, only impart a Delta-V of a half a foot per second or less, anyway. But we're continuing to track and as soon as we get some more info, we'll pass it along.;CAPCOM
152118.1;CMP; Okay. That's swell, Jack. Thank you.;CAPCOM
152162.1;CAPCOM; Sure.;CMP
152198.1;CMP;Your 6.24 sounds good. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
152201.1;CAPCOM; I'm still awake, I guess. [Pause.];CMP
152202.1;CMP; They said that it would be a while because they want to get high bit rate. They don't want to put high bit rate. [Garble].;CAPCOM
152227.1;CMP;Okay, Aquarius. We're ready. So we want some high bit rate. To do that, go over to panel 16 under Comm and close the Primary S-Band Power Amplifier. On your Comm panel ...;CAPCOM
152235.1;CMP;Okay. Okay, Jack. Wait 1. While ... I'd like to get the whole crew up for this if you don't mind.;CAPCOM
152373.1;CAPCOM; Okay.;CMP
152389.1;CMP; [Garble] they're ready to start. Yes, you want to get Freddo up. [Pause.];CAPCOM
152397.1;CAPCOM; We want to transfer some power ... I want to go to high bit rate here first, then want to transfer LM power to CSM, Fred. [Pause.];CMP
152402.1;CMP; Okay, Jim, I'll give you the Comm.;CAPCOM
152413.1;CMP; Aquarius, there's no great big rush. If you want to let Fred come up to speed slowly, why maybe that'll help out. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
152432.1;CMP; Okay. [Garble]. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
152433.1;CAPCOM; And Houston, Jack is showing Fred the procedures before we start up. [Pause.];CMP
152448.1;CMP; Say again, Jim.;CDR

152510.1;CAPCOM; Aquarius, How do you read?;CDR
152515.1;CDR; Loud and clear.;CAPCOM
152600.1;CAPCOM; Okay. I'm hearing you now. I think I missed your last transmission, Jim.;CDR
152605.1;CDR; Okay. Jack is showing Fred the procedures. Want to get him familiarized with them, and how to get out of any problems before we proceed.;CAPCOM
152606.1;CAPCOM; Roger. No rush. Just let us know when you're ready. We don't want old Freddo to slip a gimbal there. [Pause.];CDR
152614.1;CDR; Yes. We're watching him.;CAPCOM
152634.9;CAPCOM;Boy, if you took 120 hours out. Oh. [Garble]. Okay. [Garble]. Have I done what? [Long pause.];CDR
152645.9;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
152784.9;CDR; Hello, Fred. Go ahead.;LMP
152835.9;LMP;Okay, I guess the only question I have is in the first ... the very first portion involving the LM here where it has me turn on the only Bat 6, and then turn off all the Descent Batteries. Are you still reading me?;CDR
152838.9;CAPCOM;Okay. I read you until after turn off Bat 6 ... Correction, turn on only Bat 6.;LMP
152843.9;LMP;"Okay, the question is ""Only one Ascent Battery Bat 6 on the line,"" immediately followed by turning off four Descent Bats. Is that correct?";CAPCOM
152873.9;CAPCOM; That's affirmative, Fred. That question has been banged around and we decided to go that way. [Long pause.];LMP
152883.9;LMP; Let's see, we will be powering other Bus via the Cross Tie Balance Loads breaker. Is that correct?;CAPCOM
152898.9;CAPCOM;That's affirmative, and we're reading a current of 11 amps right now. [Pause.];LMP
152918.9;LMP; Okay. Okay. I guess I'm ready, then. That's how many amps?;CAPCOM
152927.9;CAPCOM;And after you turn Bat 6 on the line, you might as well take a look at the Bats 1 through 4 and so forth, and make sure that it's okay to turn them off. [Pause.];LMP
152935.9;LMP; Roger. Are your ready, gang?;CAPCOM
152940.9;CAPCOM; Yes, we're ready for the Power Amplifier and the High Bit Rate, and Normal Voice, on the Function switch, please.;LMP
152956.9;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
152961.9;CAPCOM;" Okay, gang; we've got High Bit Rate, now.";LMP
152972.9;LMP; Roger. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
152998.9;CAPCOM;Okay, we see Bat 6, On, and it looks good, Freddo.;LMP
153004.9;LMP;Okay. Am I cleared to proceed with the next step, getting 1, 2, 3, and 4, Off/Reset?;CAPCOM
153029.9;CAPCOM;Affirmative. You're cleared for Bats 1 through 4, Off/Reset.;LMP
153038.9;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
153046.9;CAPCOM; Okay. Still looks good. [Long pause.];LMP
153054.9;LMP; Okay, Houston. We need a call from you when to have Jack to proceed up into the Odyssey and start up there. [Pause.];CAPCOM
153073.9;CAPCOM;" Okay, Aquarius; and Jack can get with it right now.";LMP
153133.9;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
153154.7;CAPCOM;" Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We've completed the powerup and things look good upstairs. Are we Go for proceeding with battery charge? [Pause.]";LMP
153161.7;LMP;" Okay, Aquarius; you're Go on the battery charge.";CAPCOM
153554.7;LMP; Roger.;CAPCOM
153571.7;CAPCOM; Boy, this is really a switch, isn't it, Jack? [Pause.];LMP
153577.7;LMP; That's an understatement. You're not known for that.;CAPCOM
153639.7;LMP; Yes. I think if you add up the ... Yes ... if you add up the operating time, I think the LM beats the CSM by a considerable margin on this flight. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
153651.7;CAPCOM; Grumman just hired you.;LMP
153657.7;LMP; Yes. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
153697.7;CAPCOM;You're out there at 134,000, coming in at about 4,900 feet a second. [Pause.];LMP
153701.7;LMP; Very good.;CAPCOM
153714.7;CAPCOM;The Supercrit tank went off at about 1937 just about like it expected.;LMP
153721.7;LMP; Yes. It ... it also must of not did very much, except the rates. I was asleep then and I didn't hear a thing. [Pause.];CAPCOM
153787.7;CAPCOM; Is the command ... Service Module still venting? [Pause.];LMP
153794.7;LMP; Jack said it was just before he went up. Right now, the Sun's over there, and I can't really tell ...;CAPCOM
153808.7;CAPCOM; And...;LMP
153819.7;LMP; ... I'll look again in a minute.;CAPCOM
153825.7;CAPCOM; We asked him a long time ago if he was able to see any stars out the optics. I don't think we ever got an answer.;LMP
153827.7;CAPCOM; Okay. [Pause.];LMP
153835.7;LMP; That's a pretty good sleep station I had rigged up, Jack. I took one of the sleep restraints out of the Command Module, zipped up in it, and then hooked the tie, right at the top of the zipper, onto the LM upper hatch handle. So it kind of held me there, and then just drifted up in the tunnel upside down with my face toward the hatch, so the sunlight didn't get in my eyes and that worked pretty good.;CAPCOM
153847.7;LMP; Did you sleep pretty well that way?;CAPCOM
153878.7;CAPCOM; Yes, no problem at all.;LMP
153882.7;LMP; Is Jim sleeping that way now, or is he standing next to you?;CAPCOM
153887.7;CAPCOM; He's standing next to me.;LMP
153892.7;LMP; About time for him to go to bed.;CAPCOM
153894.7;CAPCOM;Okay. The voltage upstairs is 34.3 and the charger is reading 2.5 amps.;LMP
153900.7;LMP;Okay 34.3 and 2.5. And [garble] says [garble] ...;CAPCOM
153909.7;CAPCOM; ... pretty cold. Good.;LMP
153914.7;LMP; Say again your last.;CAPCOM
153915.7;CAPCOM; They came ... both came down here rubbing their hands, shivering. It's pretty cool upstairs. [Pause.];LMP
153919.7;LMP; Are you keeping warm in the LM? [Pause.];CAPCOM
153929.7;CAPCOM; Yes. It's pretty reasonable down here. [Long pause.];LMP
153944.7;LMP; Okay. And right now, it looks like [garble] right now, it looks like the Command Module isn't venting, Jack, so I'm going to try to take a look at the optics.;CAPCOM
153988.7;LMP; Okay. You say it is not venting?;CAPCOM
154011.7;CAPCOM; Yes. That's the word. We've just looked through the AOT and you can't see anything back there.;LMP
154015.7;LMP; Okay. And everything's fine in El Lago.;CAPCOM
154023.7;CAPCOM; Very good.;LMP
154029.7;LMP; Aquarius, we're ready to secure the high bit rate.;CAPCOM
154125.7;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];LMP
154131.7;LMP;" Houston, Aquarius; how do you read?";CAPCOM
154175.7;LMP; I'm hearing you with a lot of background noise, Freddo.;CAPCOM
154181.7;CAPCOM; Okay. How now? I just switched Omnis again.;LMP
154213.3;LMP; Aquarius, could you get a ... amps and volts readout from Odyssey, please? [Pause.].;CAPCOM
154636.3;LMP; Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.].;CAPCOM
154659.3;LMP;The CMP is dotting across there. You'd be amazed at how proficient you get at transfering to the tunnel after the first 1000 times. [Long pause.].;SC
154682.3;CAPCOM; I didn't get your last there, Freddo. We'd like you to verify that your Power Amplifier circuit breaker is open. [Pause.].;LMP
154695.3;LMP; Okay. That's verified. Power AMPL breaker is open.;CAPCOM
154699.3;CAPCOM; Roger. [Pause.];LMP
154711.3;LMP;"Okay, Jack; that's 34.6 volts and just a little bit under 2.5 amps.";CAPCOM
154719.3;CAPCOM;Okay, Fred. I copied 2.5 amps. Say again the volts, please.;LMP
154726.3;LMP;34.3 and that was just a little bit below 2.5.;CAPCOM
154732.3;CAPCOM;"34.3; thank you. [Pause.]";LMP
154744.3;LMP; Okay. [Garble] point [garble]. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
154777.3;CAPCOM; Freddo, I didn't copy the last. Say again the voltage, please. [Pause.];LMP
154788.3;LMP;Okay, and the voltage is 34.6 ... 34.6, amps slightly less than 2.5.;CAPCOM
154797.3;CAPCOM;34.6 and a little below 2.5. Thank you.;LMP
154805.3;LMP; We're ... the way we are torquing around to the side here, Jack ... We are getting some intervals where I can't hardly get to it with either of the Omnis.;CAPCOM
154819.9;LMP; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
154821.9;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Hous ... Aquarius.;LMP
154826.9;LMP; Okay. Jack reports from upstairs that he can see stars and constellations out of the optics but the Sun angle is such that it is reflecting off the LM ... portion of the LM quad and other thruster [garble] right now. [Garble] really moving around [garble].;CAPCOM
154856.9;CAPCOM; Okay. The part I got was that he can see stars and constellations and there is some sunlight reflected off the quads. That's all I got.;LMP
154868.9;LMP; Yes. The point being that, at least in the present orientation, you have to kind of wait until Sun isn't reflected off the LM to see them. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
154886.9;CAPCOM; Okay. What you're saying is you kind of have to wait until the ... there is no Sun reflection on the LM to see the stars. Is that right?;LMP
154895.9;LMP; Yes. That's for the present orientation, of course. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
154912.9;LMP; But later on, if you can stop it moving around and [garble]. [Garble].;CAPCOM
154922.9;CAPCOM; Okay ...;LMP
154923.9;LMP; [Garble]. [Pause.];CAPCOM
154934.9;CAPCOM; Okay, Freddo. And we need a volts and amps reading. [Pause.];LMP
154943.9;LMP; Okay. And bring it back upstairs. [Long pause.];CAPCOM

155191.6;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over. [Pause.];LMP
155198.6;LMP; [Garble].;CAPCOM
155200.6;CAPCOM;Okay. This is your friendly do-it-yourself kit Comm with a suggested procedure in the lithium hydroxide situation. You're looking good. We read 1.8 millimeters, and you do have sufficient LM [garble] to last you the rest of the flight. However, being on the conservative side, we would like to use one more set of Command Module canisters to guard against some possible problems with the LM, primary canister. And I have a simplified procedure for doing that, if you want to listen to it now. Over.;LMP
155280.6;CAPCOM;Okay. I think I read that you were ready. I forgot [garble] earphones. This simply consists of getting a second pair of cartridges out of the Command Module, putting one band of sticky tape, that is the gray tape, with the sticky side out, around the sides of each new canister near the top, taking a piece of EVA cue card and cutting it into four squares about 2 or 3 inches on a side, bending those at a right angle to form corner support, attaching them to the sticky tape, so that they'll stick up and overlap the old canister, and then simply putting the old canister next to the new canister and taping it up real good so it sticks together. The only other procedure is to remove the towel plug from the old cartridges and put it in the bottom of the new cartridge. And that's it. Over. [Pause.];LMP
155354.6;LMP;" Okay. As I read you, we get the gray tape and fold it so that we get ... the back sticks around the outside of the canisters, then we mount to that four sides of our [garble] cards like our EVA [garble] cards; then we overlap those cards down around the base of the canister. Then we ... then we [garble] over the [garble] at the top. [Garble]. Then we take the towel from the old ones and put them in the bottom of the new ones. [Garble]. [Garble].";CAPCOM
155420.6;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. I think you got it. I didn't completely copy your readback, but it's just that simple. We're just putting the new cartridge ... the top of the new cartridge against the bottom of the old one, moving that towel plug, using the cue cards as little corner stiffeners, and taping her up.;LMP
155444.6;LMP; Okay. The top of the new against the bottom of the old.;CAPCOM
155448.6;CAPCOM; Roger that. That way you don't have to touch the hose.;LMP

158210.0;CDR;"And, Joe, just a reminder; now that you mention it ... that it's less than 24 hours to go, what I'd like to do, and I have aboard all the procedures that you are working up; so I can run through them with the crew, and make sure that we get all our signals straight.";CAPCOM
158230.0;CAPCOM; Roger that, Jim. We are trying to get the procedures finished and up to you as quickly as we can. They exist. What's going on now is the guys are running them in the CMS/LMS, integrate, to make darn sure that the attitudes are correct and the time line is nice and relaxed and all that good stuff. And they won't be finished that run for another few hours. However, we expect to have an overall time line and a sequence of events for you before that time, and we'll start with the procedures as soon as they get ready. Over.;CDR
158275.0;CDR; Okay. That's good. I think [garble] ought to go back to the original procedures we have on board and modify them as we have the time to. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
158303.0;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim. Roger. We're going to do that to the maximum extent possible. And it looks reasonably feasible. To begin with in the Command Module we're going to have to send you some separate sequences for powering it up a little bit at a time. The closer we get to entry the more we get on the checklist. By the time we're about at EI minus 45 we're on the checklist all the way.;CDR
158324.0;CDR; Okay. [Pause.];CAPCOM
158334.0;CDR; And just as a reminder, don't forget our stowage problem. We ... We still have to do quite a bit of stowage of the drogue and probe in the LM, and, et cetera.;CAPCOM
158344.0;CAPCOM; Roger that. We've got a team working on that, and incidentally, one of the information items that they want to know is which lithium hydroxide containers in the Command Module are empty. They just want to know that for weight and balance ... and there's no rush about it ...;CDR

Over. [Long pause.]";CDR
158806.9;CAPCOM;" Okay, Aquarius; Houston. How do you read?";CDR
158810.9;CDR; Read you loud and clear.;CAPCOM
158811.9;CAPCOM;" Okay, and you're real good. It's a ... It's a pleasure not to have all that noise. Let me tell you what I want to do, Jim. As I said, we're not going to give you detailed procedures, now. What we expect to have for you shortly are procedures which we'll try and get up to you in the following form. First, we'll have a time line, sort of a thing, which will have the times of all the major events and any configurations, switch settings, and so forth which are peculiar to our configuration and which, therefore, you won't find in the checklist. This, for instance, will be true of the way we power up the Command Module; and second, of course, we'll have any redlines to the checklist so that you can enter the checklist where possible to ... to perform functions, and the time line will simply refer you to the checklist when that's appropriate. Okay?";CDR
158876.9;CDR;" Okay. Sounds good. You're going to give me an overall time line now, I take it; is that right?";CAPCOM
158880.9;CAPCOM;"That's affirm. I'm going to first of all just quickly run through the times of the major events, and then we'll go back and fill in some of the details. Okay. Entry interface is at 142 hours 40 minutes; 6Â½ hours, roughly prior to that or at about 136:10, we'll start this whole thing going by applying IMU Heater Power, by checking the CM/RCS temperatures and preheating the CM/RCS if required, and we suspect we'll probably want to do that. We'll have detailed procedures up for it later. At about 6 hours prior to EI or about 136:40, we will commence powering up the LM, powering up the AGS, using the modified LM/DPS RCS 30-minute checklist, which you have used for the previous midcourse. Then shortly, just before 5 hours, prior to EI or at about 137:40, we'll want you in the attitude for a LM AGS body axis alignment, using the Earth terminator like we did before; and as soon as we have that, we'll perform MCC-7, which looks like, now, about a 2-foot-per-second burn or about 15 seconds of RCS. And I'm told that it's down to 1-1/2 now, so it's comfortably within the RCS margin. Okay. When we do that, we'll immediately start the maneuver to the Service Module jettison attitude, which will be in plane since we're jettisoning it earlier than we usually do. We don't need, and don't want, the out-of plane component. So it'll be in plane with the Service Module pointed back out along the radius vector. We will then commence to get the Command Module ready for Service Module SEP, including Command Module RCS checkout and hot fire, and at approximately 4 hours and 30 minutes prior to EI or 138:10, we'll jettison the Service Module. We'll pitch the LM up until we acquire the Service Module in the [Garble] and try and get some photographs, but we're not going to fool around with LM translation maneuvers for pictures because we don't want to screw up ... foul up your flight path angle at that time. Okay. That gives us 2 hours to ... of more or less open time here to finish up, if we're late on that, to go on over to checklist and prepare for powering up the Command Module. We're going to start the Command Module full power-up at EI minus 2 hours and 30 minutes or 140:10 GET. We'll get the computer on the line, we'll get the IMU up, we'll start uplinking your state vectors, and so forth, and aligning the Command Module platform. At about 1 hour and 30 minutes at the latest, giving us an hour to do this Command Module stuff, we will start the maneuver to the LM jettison attitude. You'll then start to close out the LM. Of course, we don't have our stowage all configured way before this. We'll close the hatch, do a pressure integrity check, and at EI minus 1 hour, or 141 hours and 40 minutes, we'll jettison the LM. As soon as we do that, you can start the maneuver to the entry attitude. When you're there, do a sextant star check, take down the optics, and at that point we'll be giving you your final entry PAD. You can initialize the EMS, and you'll essentially be right back on the checklist at that point. There's one ... one little difference from your nominal entry. You're a little bit earlier in the morning, so it going ... it's going to be nighttime when you get to EI. However, we're fortunate enough to have the Moon in a perfect position for a horizon check. We'll give you a Moon check instead of a horizon check, and you can track it right down to moonset, which is going to be at EI roughly minus 3 minutes. And that's it for the quick time line. Do you have any questions right now? [Pause.]";CDR
159155.9;CDR; I don't believe so, Joe, right now. We'll have to look at those time lines, and think about it for a little bit.;CAPCOM
159162.9;CAPCOM; Okay. Real fine. We're ready to talk in some more detail about the alignment procedures, the CM power-up procedures, and so forth, but why don't we give you a few minutes to digest what you've already heard.;CDR
159248.9;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
159251.9;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CDR
159254.9;CDR; Two question so far on heating up the CM/RCS. We assume that's LM power, and we assume that we're going to have to power up both CM buses, right?;CAPCOM
159264.9;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. I didn't want to talk about that because we're not quite ready to recommend a procedure. We can't power up the CM/RCS per the normal checklist on the LM power because we haven't got quite enough amps. It may be that we'll want you to heat ... to do the preheat one ring at a time and we're looking at that. Another possibility' is that we may want to take down LM power at that, time, do the preheat, and then go back to LM power until we have to take it down finally. Over.;CDR
159302.9;CDR;Okay. Understand. Second question: when we finish MCC-7, that maneuver to SM Jett attitude will be angles given to us, by you, using the AGS align ball, right?;CAPCOM
159316.9;CAPCOM;That's affirmative. Once we get that AGS aligned and get a time hack on it, the good people down here will be able to give us AGS ... AGS, 8-ball attitudes for the Service Module separation attitude, for the Command Module alignment attitude, which we are going to pass you up the ... a Moon/Sun P52-type aligment. We'll have AGS 8-ball attitudes for those, and we'll be able to uplink through the Command Module once we get the computer up a preferred REFSMMAT, which will be identical to the LM attitude at the time of the burn. And we'll go into details on that later.;CDR
159367.9;CDR;Okay. Just stand by 1. I'll give it to you.;CAPCOM
159372.9;CAPCOM; Will do.;CDR
159433.9;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
159435.9;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Jim.;CDR
159439.9;CDR;We would like to have plenty of [Garble] the control characteristics are of the LM/Command Module, and whether we can use the attitude control ... controlled only to maneuver the combination to photograph the Service Module at 4 plus 30.;CAPCOM
159456.9;CAPCOM;" Okay. Good thinking. We are ... it's ... There has been a lot of consideration of what kind of maneuvers to let you do to photograph the LM, I mean the Service Module. We consider it quite low priority; the feeling is that it will be real nice to get pictures of the Service Module, but they are not required for our troubleshooting program. As far as the ... the attitude control authority, and so forth, we will get you more detailed word on that later; we are working it. It appears that using the ACA instead of the TTCA after Service Module Jett will give you excellent attitude control authority, and that's what we recommend.";CDR
159507.9;CDR; Okay. And I'm [Garble] ... use an AGS Att Hold configuration to keep the attitudes ... turn the LM Jett attitudes.;CAPCOM
159518.9;CAPCOM; That's affirm. We are ... We are probably going to recommend a tight deadband AGS attitude hold for that.;CDR
159527.9;CDR; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
159549.9;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
159551.9;CAPCOM; Go ahead.;CDR
159553.9;CDR; Okay. The star check at the entry attitude, is it a sextant star check or a COAS star check?;CAPCOM
159564.9;CAPCOM; It'll probably be a sextant star check, Jim. It really depends on how good that platform is that we get. And we expect it to be plenty good enough for a sextant star check.;CDR
159578.9;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
159579.9;CAPCOM;"While we are on that subject, Jim, I want to mention one thing to Jack. As I said, this CSM alignment procedure we are going to recommend is a Moon/Sun, and there are Sun filters stowed; they are stowed in compartment R-1; however, they are for the telescope only, of course, not the sextant. One is for the long eye-relief piece, the other for the normal eyepiece. And if he has any questions about that, we'll be glad to talk about it.";CDR
159618.9;CDR; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
159631.9;CDR; And because it will be too late to do much about a hatch integrity check if it fails, you want us to have our suits on sometime during this period?;CAPCOM
159644.9;CAPCOM;"Okay, Jim. We are laying for you on that one; it is a subject that we wanted to ... to bring up with you. We have been considering it, and our feelings are ... Of course, it is up to you, but as we see the pros and cons, you just put your finger on the Pro. We do a hatch integrity check shortly before EI minus 1 hours, and if we bust it, you would have a hard time scrambling into the suits. On the other hand, the disadvantages of wearing the suits are that they might slow you down considerably, not even counting the time to don them, and someone is even very concerned that after such and such a period of time in the suits, you might get too warm, and we might have to power up the Suit Loop to ventilate the suits and we don't particularly want to do that because it cost quite a bit of power. Consequently, our recommendation was going to be that you not wear the suit, since we have no reason to believe that the integrity check will show us anything but a slightly increased leak rate, and we can certainly hack that. What do you think? Over.";CDR
159722.9;CDR;" Well, I have confidence in the hatch, as long as it goes in and locks in smoothly; I see no reason why we need the suits, and one thing we are going to do during our spare time is to practice putting that hatch on, make sure we get it on and locked.";CAPCOM
159739.9;CAPCOM; Okay. Real good. And with that precaution, think we can concur on that decision. [Pause.];CDR
159755.9;CDR; And that's all the questions we had about the time line you gave us.;CAPCOM
159758.9;CAPCOM; Okay. Let me take a check here and see if there is anything anybody else wants to input to you, right now. [Long pause.];CDR
159798.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;CDR
159802.9;CDR; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
159803.9;CAPCOM; Roger. One detail that I thought you ought to know about the Service Module Jett is that we're going to recommend a push-pull maneuver, that is in the attitude I described. We'll want you to go half a foot per second plus-X on the LM, then jettison the Service Module, then go half a foot per second minus-X, which will be less time because you're suddenly a heck of a lot lighter. Over. [Pause.];CDR
159837.9;CDR; Okay. Understand. You want me to go a half a foot per second plus-X, Jett the Service Module, and go a half a foot per second minus-X.;CAPCOM
159849.9;CAPCOM; That's affirm. We think that will give you plenty of separation, and also will be a slow enough rate so you'll have a chance to get some photos.;CDR
159930.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;CDR
159932.9;CDR; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
159934.9;CAPCOM;Okay. One more thing we want to update you on with a little detail. As we told you, the SM Sep attitude was in plane and the LM Jett attitude will be more similar to a normal Service Module SEP attitude, that is it will be LM up, out the radius vector and 45 degrees right, out of plane toward the south. We are going to recommend that prior to Jett, the configuration be with the LM overhead hatch closed, with the vent valve open, and we'll Jett with the tunnel pressurized. Over. [Long pause.];CDR
159994.9;CDR; Okay, Joe. Understand that the LM Jett attitude will be similar to Service Module normal jettison, which will be up and out of plane, and as soon as I finish maneuvering to left Jett attitude, I'll scramble up and close the LM hatch, making sure the vent valve is open, and then we'll vent it ... or jettison it with the tunnel pressurized.;CAPCOM
160020.9;CAPCOM; That's affirmative. And Deke says don't forget to close the Command Module hatch on your way in.;CDR
160029.9;CDR; I'm already scared that Jack will have it closed before I get up there.;CAPCOM
160033.9;CAPCOM; (Laughter) [Long pause.];CDR
160052.9;CAPCOM; Okay, Jim. I think that's about all we have for you right now. Whenever you feel like you don't have any more questions at the moment, we'd like you to reconfigure for down voice backup and we'd like you to do that to move the Voice Function switch to Down Voice Backup as usual, but instead of pulling the circuit breaker, we'd like you to throw the Power AMP switch to off. [Long pause.];CDR
160104.9;CDR;Okay, Joe. I have one more question, here. If we get a little bit ahead of time on the Command Module full power-up after we jettison the Service Module, I'd like to go to LM Jett attitude early, and make sure we get that part squared away and sit there for a while before LM Jett of 1 hour. Now, will we be using LM power up to that time? There's two cables which we'll probably have to disconnect on the way up through the tunnel if we're still going to use LM power?;CAPCOM
160134.9;CAPCOM; That's affirmative. Let me get word on when we expect to go off LM power. [Long pause.];CDR
160158.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;CDR
160162.9;CDR; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
160163.9;CAPCOM;Roger. We expect to go off LM power at the time we start powering up the CSM or about minus 2-1/2 hours. That is not a hard number, and we'll be updating you on it. As far as going to the LM Jett attitude, that's completely permissible as soon as you have a powered up Command Module and a satisfactory platform, you can go there immediately. We're giving you a maximum of 1 hour just for grins. Over.;CDR
160198.9;CDR; Okay. Fine. And that will be a LM maneuver, I assume, because we lost the Service Module, so no strain there.;CAPCOM
160206.9;CAPCOM; Affirm. [Pause.];CDR
160213.9;CDR;And, Jack, would like to know what entry angle the midcourse-7 will give us?;CAPCOM
160222.9;CAPCOM; Oh, it'll put us right in the middle of the corridor, Jim.;CDR
160228.9;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
160229.9;CAPCOM;6.50 degrees. And, Jim, Houston. I guess, as a last item we expect that it will take us about an hour to update your checklist and your time lines sometime later on today, and we'd just like you to consider that. I expect it'll be 3 or 4 hours before we have all that stuff ready.;CDR
160256.9;CDR; Okay. We'll be standing by for that, and now Power Amplifier switch is going to go off, and then we'll be going to Down Voice Backup.;CAPCOM
160263.9;CAPCOM; Okay.;CDR

162093.5;LMP;" Boy, you wouldn't believe this LM right now; it's nothing but bags from floor to ceiling.";CAPCOM
162099.5;CAPCOM; Hey, that brings up a question. We were wondering where you guys plan to stow the probe and drogue? It occurred to us that one possibility was to stow it in the LM, down about where the LMP normally stands, underneath the IS ... ISAer. Perhaps you have a better idea. Over.;LMP
162125.5;LMP; Yes, I do, Vance. [Garble] would go in the LM, but I thought maybe we ought to stow it where the CDR stands. How's that?;CAPCOM
162135.5;CAPCOM; Okay. I can tell that you're just getting ... getting that one over because Jim just got off the loop.;LMP
162146.5;LMP; Yes, he's sleeping. No, that's ... that's actually where we normally had been stowing it for normal LM Jetts.;CAPCOM
162157.5;CAPCOM; Okay, and ... Hey, we just ... we'll record that, and figure that you'll stow the probe and drogue over in the ... where the CDR stands.

162180.5;LMP;"Stand by; stand by 1.";CAPCOM
162181.5;CAPCOM; Okay.;LMP
162187.5;LMP; I think Jack hauled off the piece of paper with that ... all that on it. Why don't you hold it until Jack gets done doing the battery charge?;CAPCOM
162197.5;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];LMP
162212.5;CAPCOM; And, Fred, request PCM on Lo bit rate, now.;LMP
162217.5;LMP; Okay. And there was one piece of flight data that we needed that we didn't bring along this time.;CAPCOM
162233.5;CAPCOM; What was that?;LMP
162237.5;LMP; That's a big book with a lot of just plain old blank pages in it.;CAPCOM
162243.5;CAPCOM; Yes, when you ... when you get off nominal, why you just need scratch paper, don't you?;LMP
162250.5;LMP; Yes.;CAPCOM
162321.5;LMP; Okay, Vance. I got the stowage list now.;CAPCOM
162325.5;CAPCOM; Okay, I gave you two lists ...;LMP
162326.5;LMP; And Jack's got ... and Jack said he's completed ... the ... secured the battery charge now.;CAPCOM
162337.5;CAPCOM; Okay, and we're recording the time that that was complete. You have two lists there, one is LM to CM equipment transfer and the second list is the reverse. Request you scratch the last item on the first list, which is returning used bags to the CM.;LMP
162364.5;LMP; Okay. We didn't have any of those, so that didn't pose any problem anyway.;CAPCOM
162373.5;CAPCOM; Okay.;LMP
162441.5;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;LMP
162442.5;CMP; Okay, Vance. Aquarius is back on.;CAPCOM
162445.5;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. Understand you completed securing the battery charge. Now if you are ready to copy, Jack, I would like to give you the two changes that we have to the power-up for the TM procedure. Over.;CMP
162468.5;CMP;Okay. Stand by 1.;CAPCOM
162469.5;CAPCOM; Okay.;CMP
162532.5;CMP; Okay, Vance. You say you have some changes in the procedures that I used before to get telemetry and to check out the CSM system?;CAPCOM
162540.5;CAPCOM;"Yes, that's correct, Jack; they're pretty simple. About halfway through the procedure, we have a step on panel 3, which is Power Ampl, High; we'd like to change that to Power Ampl, Low. [Pause.]";CMP

162566.5;CAPCOM;"And the next change, Jack, is panel 275. Scratch the step ""CB Main B, Bat B, close ... Bat Bus B, close.";CMP
162583.5;CMP;" Okay. You want to delete the step ""CB Main B, Bat Bus B, Close"".";CAPCOM
162588.5;CAPCOM; Roger. As you know, we're going to do this on LM power, so this reflects that.;CMP
162597.5;CMP; Okay. Real fine.;CAPCOM
162600.5;CAPCOM;"Okay, and have at it. We ... we'd like to have the TM up for about 5 or 10 minutes to look at the data from the CM; look at your temperatures, et cetera. And after that, we'll go back to charging the battery again, and the charge will probably go until around GET 126.";CMP
162620.5;CMP; Okay. Do you want the same readouts from me that I gave you before?;CAPCOM
162627.5;CAPCOM;"That's affirmative, Jack. And just to make sure that there is no mistaking the procedure, it starts out for the backout part: panel 3, Power Ampl, Off; Transponder, Off; AC Inverter 2, Off; then goes to panel 250, et cetera. [Pause.]";CMP
162660.5;CMP; That's ... that's the way I read it.;CAPCOM

162666.5;CMP;" Okay; going back up into the refrigerator.";CAPCOM
162670.5;CAPCOM; Hey, I thought it was the bedroom.;CMP
162675.5;CMP;Well, it's got a new name now, because it is about 30 degrees cooler.;CAPCOM
162683.5;CAPCOM; Roger. Returning to the deep freeze ...;CMP
162684.5;CMP;... Hey, Vance. One thing that I wanted to ask you ... is on the stowage list where you have us putting the black-and-white TV camera on top of A-7 in an A-8 [Garble] decontamination bag, I was wondering if it would be possible or if you ... there would be any problem in putting it into B-6 along with the two 70-millimeter Hasselblad cameras?;CAPCOM
162715.5;CAPCOM; Jack, I don't think there'll be any problem, if you can get it in, but let us get ... work that and get back with you. Okay?;CMP
162723.5;CMP;All right. I was just thinking. I'm trying to get as much weight as possible down there in that LEB. We have no SRCs and then our waste tank is ... you know ... rather depleted. I think it's about down to 40 percent or so. So I'm trying to get as much L over D as I can, and any heavy items we can get down there, I'd be greatly appreciative of you bringing it to our attention.;CAPCOM
162752.5;CAPCOM; Okay. We copy that, and we owe you an answer on your last question.;CMP
162759.5;CMP; Okay. And I'm in work, going to give you some telemetry.;CAPCOM
162764.5;CAPCOM; Okay.;CMP

162830.6;LMP; All right. Go ahead.;CAPCOM
162832.6;CAPCOM;" Fred, we have enough data; recommend that Jack take off the TM and power back down again, using his backout procedure. Just let us know when he does it.";LMP
162847.6;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
162850.6;CAPCOM; And, after that, we'll start the battery charge, and we'll have to know when he starts that.;LMP
162858.6;LMP; Okay. He's starting to back out now. Just out of curiosity, what ... did you all get a readout on what the cabin temp was up there? [Pause.];CAPCOM
162871.6;CAPCOM;Yes, we're getting 45 to 46 degrees. [Pause.];LMP
162882.6;LMP; Now you see why we call it the refrigerator.;CAPCOM
162886.6;CAPCOM; Yes, it's kind of a cold winter day up there, isn't it? Is it snowing in the Command Module yet?;LMP
162901.6;LMP; Is it what, Vance?;CAPCOM
162903.6;CAPCOM; Is it snowing in there yet? [Pause.];LMP
162910.6;LMP; Oh, snowing. No ... no, not quite. The windows are in pretty bad shape, and I guess the Service Module ... we'll be trying to shoot out of the LM window, because every window in the Command Module is just covered with water droplets. It's going to take a lot of scrubbing to get those cleared off.;CAPCOM
162932.6;CAPCOM; Roger. Understand. Pete says to tell you that you'll have some time on the beach in Samoa to thaw out after this cold experience. [Pause.];LMP
162948.6;LMP; Hey, that sounds great. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
162972.6;LMP;Vance, have you all thought about what cameras you wanted to use? Right now, we've got configured a Hasselblad with a 250, and I've got the lunar-surface number 1 Hasselblad, and I've got the lunar surface sequence camera, also, rigged and ready to go. Did you have any other druthers about the [Garble];CAPCOM
162997.6;CAPCOM; You are referring to the photography of the Service Module, is that right?;LMP
163003.6;LMP; That's right.;CAPCOM
163004.6;CAPCOM; We have some procedures in work, and I've seen them, Fred. I think pretty soon we'll be shooting them up to you to specify which cameras and settings. But that ... that sounds pretty close.;LMP
163021.6;LMP; Okay, you might let them know that, if they hadn't thought of it, that we got this lunar-surface sequence camera on board which has its own battery pack setup, and to shoot quite a few pictures with, and that could also be used for this.;CAPCOM
163035.6;CAPCOM; Roger. I know we are planning to use that camera, among others.;LMP
163042.6;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
163051.6;LMP;" Okay, Houston; Aquarius. Jack has backed out of powering up the CM, and now he's proceeding to restart battery charge on Bat A.";CAPCOM

163108.8;CAPCOM; And, Fred, request now first reading of voltage ... Bat A voltage and charger current. Over.;CMP
163122.8;CMP;Okay, Vance. I can give it to you. I read it right after I started it. Bat A voltage was 39.4 and the current had jumped up to 1.4.;CAPCOM
163137.8;CAPCOM;Okay. 39.4 and 1.4. Thanks, Jack.;CMP
163142.8;CMP; Okay. How about ... You ready for some other readouts, that you wanted there?;CAPCOM

163257.8;CAPCOM;Roger. About 126:30 is an estimate, Jack.;CMP
163265.8;CMP; Okay. You figure it will be fully charged then, huh?;CAPCOM
163268.8;CAPCOM;Yes. That's right. We'll have all the batteries up to about 116 amps-hours. [Pause.];CMP
163280.8;CMP; That's good news.;CAPCOM

164189.1;CMP; Okay. But I guess what I was really asking is, if you'd have any violent objections if we filled two drink bags from LM water rather than repressurizing the surge tank.;CAPCOM
164201.1;CAPCOM; Okay. Stand by on that.;CMP
164202.1;CMP; Also, Jim is asleep up there and we didn't want to bother him, either.;CAPCOM
164208.1;CAPCOM; Okay. We understand. [Pause.];CMP
164216.1;CAPCOM;"And, Jack, we'll be changing stations in 1 minute; so, we may have a temporary dropout in Comm. [Pause.]";CMP
164224.1;CMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
164231.1;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. [Pause.];CMP
164240.1;CMP; Okay, Vance. Go ahead. Loud and clear.;CAPCOM
164242.1;CAPCOM;" Okay, Jack. We're going to bargain with you on this one. Instead of two, would ... wish that you would just get just one bag full. That shouldn't do any harm; however ...";CMP
164254.1;CMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
164255.1;CAPCOM; ... we are not all that fat on water that we want to do any drinking out of the LM as a regular thing after this one bag. So would you let us know when you get the water out and give us a mark on it so we can watch the TM. Over.;CMP
164275.1;CMP; Okay. Freddo is about to withdraw the water now.;CAPCOM
164283.9;CMP;Okay, Vance. We've withdrawn ... oh, about 8 ounces of water.;CAPCOM
164291.9;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. How's it taste?;CMP
164300.9;CMP; It's ... kind of good. It's not quite as gaseous as that in the Command Module.;CAPCOM
164310.3;CAPCOM;Apollo 13, Houston ... or rather, Aquarius, Houston. Over.;CMP
164317.3;CMP; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
164319.3;CAPCOM; Hey, Jack, we need another reading. Volts and amps.;CMP
164323.3;CMP; Okay. They're coming up.;CAPCOM
164329.6;CMP;Vance, you won't believe this, but Freddo says it's 39.4 and 1.245.;CAPCOM
164338.6;CAPCOM; Okay. Our EECOM is recording those numbers. Charlie Dumas, this time.;CMP
164346.6;CMP; Oh. [Pause.];CAPCOM
164355.6;CAPCOM; Not changing very fast, is it?;CMP
164361.6;CMP; How far out are we? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
164374.6;CAPCOM;Okay. 953 and 6068 on velocity, per FIDO.;CMP
164381.6;CMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
164382.6;CAPCOM; Bill Stoval.;CMP
164383.6;CMP; Thank you.;CAPCOM
164389.2;CDR; Houston, Aquarius. Over;CAPCOM
164395.2;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CDR
164399.2;CDR; Are the flowers in bloom in Houston?;CAPCOM
164402.2;CAPCOM; No, not yet. Still must be winter.;CDR
164409.2;CDR; Suspicions confirmed.;CAPCOM
164414.2;CAPCOM; Yes, I doubt if they will be blooming even Saturday, when you return. [Pause.];CDR
164422.2;CDR; I concur.;CAPCOM
164424.2;CAPCOM; Hey, Jim, we have some photo information to pass up to you. Discussed this briefly with Fred earlier. It's instructions or suggestions for which photos ... which cameras and lenses to use during your Service Module photography. Over.;CDR
164448.2;CDR;Understand. Stand by 1.;CAPCOM
164450.2;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];CDR
164474.2;CDR; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
164476.2;CAPCOM;Okay. We have three cameras here, two of them to be used for picture taking from the LM, one to be used from the number 5 window of the CSM. First, I'll hit the LM cameras. And this camera that I mention now has first priority. It's considered the one to give you the best results. That's the 70-millimeter DC Reseau camera, Hasselblad, that is, with the 80-millimeter lens, from box A-13. Suggest fresh magazine of 3400 black-and-white film. [Long pause.];CDR
164539.2;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
164543.2;CAPCOM;Okay. Suggest either magazine R or magazine S from A-13. Transfer all of this to the LM and recommend the following settings: LM/DC/80/BW 3400 (f:5.6 at a 250th). [Pause.];CDR
164597.2;CAPCOM; And that's all for that one.;CDR
164601.2;CDR;Okay, Vance. Let me see if I have it here. For the LM, want to use the 70-millimeter DC Hasselblad 80-millimeter lens in A-13, using 3400 black-and-white film Mags R or S. Prepare to take camera to the LM, and the setting would be the LM/DC/80/BW 3400 (f:5.6) at a 250th.;CAPCOM
164625.2;CAPCOM;That's correct. Okay. Next: the next camera ... Stand by 1. I've got noise here. Okay. The next LM ... The next camera for the LM will be the 16-millimeter, and these photos are considered to be priority 3. Okay. One, get the 16-millimeter DAC and powerpack from A-8. Get the 10-millimeter lens, and remove it ... remove the 10-millimeter lens, and take the 18-millimeter lens from B-3 and attach it to the camera. And attach the power cable transfer to the LM, set frame rate at 12 frames per second, and the same data line that I gave you before reads this way this time. LM/DAC/18/CEX, battery (f:8 and 1/250th). Okay. Now looking at these two cameras in the LM, it's recommended that you use the 16-millimeter for the first 2-1/2 minutes and then switch to the 70-millimeter. That's partly because the frame's been ... or the ... They've been optimized for closer and longer range. Okay. Read back, please.;CDR
164776.2;CDR;Okay, Vance. Essentially, what you wanted to use as far as the movie camera in the LM goes, is our lunar sequence camera which is attached to the powerpack. We use the 18-millimeter lens, set it at 12 frames per second [Garble] f:8 at 250th of a second.;CAPCOM
164799.2;CAPCOM;Roger. f:8 at 250th. [Pause.];CDR
164807.2;CDR;"Right; f:8 at 250th.";CAPCOM
164812.2;CAPCOM;Okay. Would you believe that we have a correction now to the last camera I gave you? Correct that 18-millimeter lens to 75-millimeter lens.;CDR
164829.2;CDR;Okay. The 18-millimeter to the 75-millimeter lens. Okay.;CAPCOM
164834.2;CAPCOM;Right. Okay. Next for the Command Module pictures, it may be a little hard to see the Service Module from the Command Module, but if you can see it, it will be through window 5, people down here think. Recommend for that the CM 70-millimeter. These photos have priority 2. So this is 70-millimeter EL, with ... which has the 80-millimeter attached, and this is all in B-3. Take off the 80-millimeter lens and attach the 250-millimeter lens. And the 250-millimeter lens can be found in U-4. Use CEX film from A-13. Ring sight from A-7, and these pictures will be f:8 at a 250th. And I think probably by now you probably all have ... already have these cameras configured, and this may be redundant information, but here it is anyway. Over.;CDR
164923.2;CDR;Okay, Vance. You're right. We do have cameras almost configured like you said. For the Command Module, you think that the EL with the 250 lens, CEX film, f:8 at a 250th is the best bet, and you're saying now that where you think you'll see it is out window 5? Is that it?;CAPCOM
164945.2;CAPCOM; That's right, Jim.;CDR
164949.2;CDR;Okay. My procedure, now, after Service Module Jett is going to be to pitch up, in order to try to get the Service Module into the ... to get the center window in view of the Service Module, which we are going to have somebody there ... to photograph. Why do you think window 5 will be it?;CAPCOM
164992.2;CAPCOM; Okay. Stand by on that one. This is a question of geometry, and I'll get right back.;CDR
165024.8;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;CDR
165028.8;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
165030.8;CAPCOM;"Jim, regarding window 5, I have a drawing here; and, when you're docked, you have approximately a 60-degree angle between the Z-axes of the two spacecraft. It appears that peering out window 5, you would be looking at the rendezvous radar on top of the LM which would, if you pitched, more or less give you a view of the Service Module. That is, if you pitched, so ... from ... and I think that this has been run by quite a few folks here; so, offhand, I can't see where any other window would be as good or perhaps even possible.";CDR
165086.8;CDR;Okay. I understand. Yes, you're right. When we look out window 5, we can see rendezvous radar, and we'll try ... We'll try window 5.;CAPCOM
165095.8;CAPCOM; Roger. It presumes, though, that there has to be a pitch to be able to see it. You guys sound a lot more rested today.;CDR
165107.8;CDR; Well, I just went back and sacked out for an hour or so and didn't get back up.;CAPCOM
165114.8;CAPCOM; Very good.;CDR
165185.8;CAPCOM; And, Jim, Houston. We really are going to get those checklists up to you.;CDR
165191.8;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
165212.8;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;CDR
165292.8;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;CDR

165298.8;CAPCOM; Jim, it's time for readings on the battery charging again. Request the Bat A voltage and the charger amps. Over.;CDR
165308.8;CDR; Okay. Stand by, Vance.;CAPCOM
165332.2;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
165334.2;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Jim.;CDR
165337.2;CDR; Okay. We have no more water in the potable tank. We tried to get some more out a few minutes ago, and there isn't any.;CAPCOM
165346.2;CAPCOM; Okay. Understand you ran out of water in the CM potable tank.;CDR
165352.2;CDR; Affirmative.;CAPCOM
165360.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over. [Long pause.];CDR
165393.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Over.;CDR
165397.9;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
165399.9;CAPCOM; Jim, we - you were able to get those voltage - Bat A voltage and current readings?;CDR
165405.9;CDR; Oh, yes just a minute. Fred's - Fred's up there now.;CAPCOM
165408.9;CAPCOM; Okay. And we're ready to read you the first checklist installment. This will - What we're going to readup is going to be a LM time line, a CSM time line, and checklist changes to conform with these. And right now I have the first installment of the CSM time line ready to read up. Over.;CDR
165440.9;CDR;" Okay, Jack. I'm going to get - Vance, I'm going to get Jack on the line for that; and so stand by.";CAPCOM
165446.9;CAPCOM; Okay. And he'll need a lot of paper. [Pause.];CDR
165453.9;CDR;"Okay. Volts are 39.5; amps, 1.24. Stand by.";CAPCOM
165464.9;CAPCOM; Okay. We got it. [Long pause.];CDR
165491.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. [Long pause.];CMP
165513.9;CMP; Okay, Vance. I'm on and ready to copy.;CAPCOM
165517.9;CAPCOM;Okay, Jack. Wait 1. We want to get one into the hands of Flight and EECOM, and it'll take about a minute or 2. Sorry to wake you up for this, but take about a minute, and then we'll read it up to you.;CDR
165532.1;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;CDR
165537.1;CMP; Okay, Vance. Go ahead.;CAPCOM
165539.1;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. Do you have any of that CM water - bagged water, left? Over.;CMP
165547.1;CMP; Negative. I went up and tried to repressurize the surge tank and get another shot of water, and was able to repressurize the surge tank okay, but there was no water that came out of the water tank.;CAPCOM
165561.1;CAPCOM; Yes. We understand that there isn't any more in the potable tank, but we understood that you had put some water from that tank into bags, and I wondered if any of the bags were left.;CMP
165573.1;CMP; Negative.;CAPCOM
165575.1;CAPCOM; Okay.;CMP
165582.7;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. Ready to copy?;CMP
165589.7;CMP; Okay, Vance. Ready to copy.;CAPCOM
165591.7;CAPCOM;Okay. Start at EI minus 6Â½ hours. You're going to re - get LM PADs and CSM PADs, and I don't know if you want to copy them or not. This is something I can just read off to you. Over. Without you copying unless you especially want it.;CMP
165617.7;CMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
165619.7;CAPCOM; Okay. LM pad, SM jettison...;CMP
165625.7;CMP; Okay. Go ahead, read which ones we're going to get.;CAPCOM
165628.7;CAPCOM;" Okay. I'll read them fast first here so you get a general idea. LM PAD, Service Module Jett attitude, Moon viewing attitude, Sun viewing attitude, and LM Jett attitude. The CM PADs are coarse align angles for LM attitudes during Moon and Sun sightings, coarse align angles for entry REFSMMAT, and CMC angles on entry REFSMMAT for LM Jett. Moon viewing, and entry. Okay. That - That's general PAD information. If you want, I'll read it slowly so you can copy it all down; otherwise, I'll go ahead. [Long pause.]";CMP
165690.7;CMP; I got - I was trying to copy it as you were reading it, Vance. The LM PAD are Service Module jettison attitude, Moon viewing attitude, Sun viewing attitude, and LM jettison attitude. Is that correct?;CAPCOM
165704.7;CAPCOM; That's correct. Okay. I'll read the CM PADs now, slowly. Coarse align angles for LM attitudes during Moon and Sun sightings. [Long pause.];CMP
165741.7;CAPCOM;Okay. The next coarse align angles for entry REFSMMAT. Okay. The next, CMC angles on entry REFSMMAT for (1) LM Jett, (2) Moon viewing, (3) entry. Okay. I'll stand by until you read that back.;CMP
165817.7;CMP;Okay. The CSM pads will be coarse align angles for LM attitudes during Moon and Sun sightings. Coarse align angles for entry REFSMMAT. CMC - CMC angles on entry REFSMMAT for (1) LM Jettison, (2) Moon viewing, (3) entry.;CAPCOM
165847.7;CAPCOM; Okay. That's correct. [Long pause.];CMP
165883.7;CAPCOM;Okay, Jack. Going to hold up 1. All the hordes of people that devised this procedure are going to be coming into the room in a minute, and they'd like to hold up until everybody can listen in. [Long pause.];CMP
165924.7;LMP; Get that, Jack? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
165950.7;CMP; Okay, Vance. We're ready to go.;CAPCOM
165954.7;CAPCOM;Okay. We lost you there briefly while you were in an attitude where we couldn't receive you. Jack, we'd like to hold off for about 5 minutes. We have some more people coming in to listen to this, and it took a lot of people to devise this procedure, and a few people have been testing it out, so we'd like to have them all on hand while we give you the rest.;CMP
165981.7;CMP; Okay. [Pause.];SC
165988.7;SC; How's the temperature up there, Jack? You guys chopping wood to keep warm?;CMP
165994.7;CMP;Deke, it's about 51, I think, or 50 in the LM, and it's about - I don't know - 45 or little bit less in the Command Module.;SC
166009.7;SC; Oh, it's a nice fall day, huh?;CMP
166014.7;CMP; Yes, I tell you, we don't have to worry about chilldown.;CAPCOM
166026.7;CMP; Okay, Vance. While we're waiting, do you have there also what I can expect ground to uplink me?;CAPCOM
166040.7;CAPCOM; We'll have that, Jack, but - Stand by for that.;CMP
166048.7;CMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
166064.7;CAPCOM; Jack, probably - probably the thing to do is to give you all of the checklist, and it will include things like this. Then we'll have a big question and answer session afterwards, if that's okay by you.;CMP
166080.7;CMP; Okay. That sounds good.;CAPCOM
166093.9;CMP; Okay, Vance. While we're waiting, just for your information, the Command Module has been stowed per your checklist with the exception of the two Hasselblad cameras. [Pause.];SC
166112.9;SC; Roger. Got that, Jack. [Pause.];CMP
166123.9;CMP; And the LM is pretty well stowed with the exception when we have yet to bring in the probe and the drogue. [Pause.];SC
166132.9;SC; Roger. Got that. [Long pause.];CMP
166156.9;SC; Relative to your water situation, Jack, we're going to have a pretty good hack on the LM here in the next few hours, and we anticipate letting you fill your own tanks before we transfer over, so you should be in reasonably good shape there.;CMP
166173.9;CMP;Okay. We have a number of juice bags all cut and ready to go, and we tried to get the water out of the Command Module about 20 minutes ago and found out that the Command Module's potable tank was empty. So we have no bags made up now, so we're dependent on LM water, PLSS water.;SC
166200.9;SC; Roger. If you feel like trying the PLSS, that's all excess, and you might want to try that at any time. I'm sure it'll taste like PLSS but you might as well try it. [Pause.];CMP
166218.9;CMP; Okay.;SC
166309.9;CMP;Okay, Deke. All the windows in the Command Module are heavily coated with water right now. So I don't know what kind of pictures we'll get out of them, but I'm going to try and clean them off and do the best I can with the 250-millimeter lens on the Hasselblad.;SC
166328.9;SC; Roger. That's why we have the top priority stuff in the LM. We figure you've got a much better chance of getting it through there.;CMP
166336.9;CMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
166369.5;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;CMP
166374.5;CMP; Are you ready to send it up, Vance?;CAPCOM
166376.5;CAPCOM;Jack, before we start reading the procedure, we'd like - We find that Bat A is topped off and in great shape. Like to switch over and top off Bat B some more. Give it 2 more hours of charging. Have about a seven- or eight-step procedure here to give you, if you want to copy that. We're switching before we start recording the entry procedures.;CMP
166403.5;CMP; Okay. Stand by and let me get out my other checklist. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
166419.5;CMP; Okay, Vance. Ready to copy.;CAPCOM
166424.5;CAPCOM;"Okay. Panel 3: switch Battery Charge to Off. Panel 5; Main Bus Tie Bat A/C to Bat A/C; CB Battery Charger, Bat A Charge to open; CB Battery Charger, Bat B Charge, Close. Next, panel 250; CB Bat B Power Entry/Postlanding to Close. Panel 5; Main Bus Tie, Bat B/C, off. Panel 3; Battery Charge to B. Advise; well, stand by. Jack, advise that we have a backout procedure for this, but we'll read that up to you later, in about 2 hours. And, also, that this procedure is a Delta to your - the first battery charging procedure that we gave you. In other words, it's a Delta from where you are right now. [Pause.]";CMP
166595.5;CMP;"Okay. This is the procedure for charging Bat Baker. Panel 3; Bat Charge, Off; panel 5; Main Bus Tie, Bat A/C to A/C; CB Bat Charger, Bat A Charge, open; CB Bat Charger, Bat B Charge, Close. Panel 250; CB Bat B Power Entry and Postlanding, Close. Panel 5; Main Bus Tie, Bat B/C, to Off; Panel 3; Bat Charge to B. This is a Delta for the first battery charging procedure; you'll give me the backout procedure in a couple hours.";CAPCOM
166632.5;CAPCOM; That's affirm.;CMP
166636.5;CMP; Okay. I'll put it in work right now, then come back and stand by to copy the rest of - well, I - not the rest - everything.;CAPCOM
166646.5;CAPCOM; Everything is right. [Pause.];CMP
166658.5;CAPCOM; You'd never believe how much this procedure's been massaged in the last day.;CMP
166705.3;CMP;"Okay, Vance. I put Bat Baker on charge; I don't think it quite had stabilized. It was reading 1.1 amps, 39.6 volts when I left up there. [Pause.]";CAPCOM
166726.3;CAPCOM; Okay. We got that.;CMP
166731.3;CMP; Okay. I guess now is as good a time to start as any. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
166745.3;CAPCOM; Just a second, Jack.;CMP
166829.3;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;CMP
166834.3;CMP; Okay, Vance. You're kind of weak, but readable.;CAPCOM
166838.3;CAPCOM;Jack, we're going to need readings on the Bat volt and charger amps about every 10 or 15 minutes for a while, so is there somebody else that can be reading them out while you're copying? Over.;CMP
166854.3;CMP; Yes. Jim will take a run up there. Freddo is sleeping right now. We're trying to get some sleep here, and Jim'll run up and take a look at voltage and current whenever you call.;CAPCOM
166866.3;CAPCOM; Okay.;CDR
166938.3;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
166941.3;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CDR
166944.3;CDR; Vance, we've got to realize that we've got to establish a work-rest cycle up here, so we just can't wait around here to just read procedures all the time up to the burn. We've got to get them up here, look at them, and then we've got to get the people to sleep. So take that into consideration when you get ready to uh, to send up the PADs.;CAPCOM
166965.3;CAPCOM;I know, Jim. We're very conscious of that. We - we should be ready to go in about 5 minutes. That's all I can say. Stand by.;CDR
166980.3;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
167003.1;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;CMP
167008.1;CMP; Okay, Vance. We're ready to go.;CAPCOM
167011.1;CAPCOM; Okay. We need a - Sorry [laughter]. We need a readout. Volts and amps. [Pause.];CMP
167020.1;CMP; Okay. In work.;CAPCOM
167025.1;CAPCOM;And, might as well bring the Comm up to a higher fidelity for this long period of checklist reading. That requires, panel 16: CB Primary S-Band Power Amp, Closed. [Long pause.];CMP
167052.1;CMP; Okay, Primary S-Band Power Amp closed now. How do you read?;CAPCOM
167055.1;CAPCOM;Okay. And next step, panel 12: S-Band Function to Voice and Ranging Function to Ranging. [Long pause.];CMP
167100.1;CMP; Okay, Vance. The S-Band Function is at Voice and the Ranging switch was at Ranging.;CAPCOM
167107.1;CAPCOM; Okay. That makes it so we can hear you better, Jack. [Pause.];CMP
167116.1;CMP; Okay. Can we - Since the first part of it, you're just going to read and I'm going to copy and we're going to have a question and answer period later, can we get started?;CAPCOM
167127.1;CAPCOM; Okay. Procedure's coming back in again. Multicopies for distribution. And Ken's back. He's a local expert on this now, so we'll turn you over to him and he'll read it off.;CMP
167142.1;CMP; Okay. Stand by. I'll give you volts and amps. [Pause.];CAPCOM
167149.1;CMP;"Okay. The voltage is 39.1; amps, 1.75.";CAPCOM
167155.1;CAPCOM; Okay. [Long pause.];CMP
167178.1;SC;" Hello, Aquarius; Houston. How do you read?";CAPCOM
167183.1;CMP; Okay. Very good, Ken.;SC
167185.1;SC;"Okay. Let me take it from the top here. Just - there might be some overlap, but to make sure we're all on the same signal. We're starting off with a set of time line procedures that are going to give us - end up with the normal entry checklist. There will be some checklist changes into the book, but the bulk of what I have for you is the time line stuff. And it starts at 6 hours and 30 minutes prior to EI and assumes that we're getting LM power to Main B in the Command Module. I think you already have the numbers for the LM PADs and the Command Module PADs; I mean the types of PADs we'll be giving you. And if you have a question on what they'll be doing or what they're for, I can go over those now or when we get through.";CMP
167237.1;CMP; Okay. Yes, I'll make a little note there, and we'll discuss it when we get everything copied, huh?;SC
167245.1;SC;All right. And the first item, then, after you get ready to start this checklist, is to install lithium hydroxide canisters and to stow ORDEAL. On panel 8, we want to turn the Floodlights to Fixed.;CMP
167263.1;CMP; Okay. Wait a minute. You're going too fast, here.;SC
167266.1;SC;Okay. I'll tell you. I'll go line at a time and wait for your verification before I go on to the next one. I have panel 8, Floodlights, Fixed.;CMP
167293.1;CMP; Okay. Install LiOH canisters, stow ORDEAL, Floodlight, Fixed.;SC

168439.1;CMP;Okay. Perform the Command Module RCS check per step 4, page 2-1.;SC
168444.1;SC; That's correct. Okay, at this point, we want to lock the rotation hand controllers. [Long pause.];CMP
168464.1;CMP; Okay. After that, lock both rotation hand controllers.;SC
168469.1;SC;That's affirm. On panel 8: Sequential, Pyro Arm, two to Arm. [Long pause.];CMP
168492.1;CMP;Okay. Panel 8: set Pyro Arm, two, to Arm. Do I get a MSFN Go for that?;SC
168498.1;SC; That's negative, Jack. We haven't powered up any of the downlink at this time. You'll be doing this and the Command Module RCS pressurization both by yourself.;CMP
168512.1;CMP; Okay.;SC
168515.1;SC;Okay. Now, the next event is going to be the separation of the Service Module, and these are some LM steps, but so that you will know what is going on, I'll read them to you. The LM will do a LM plus-X of one-half foot per second. Then you'll be hitting the CM SM Sep, On and up, on their command. As soon as we are free of the Service Module, the LM will do another LM minus-X for 0.5 feet per second. This is called the push-pull maneuver. I think it was described this afternoon. [Pause.];CMP
168561.1;CMP; Yes, Ken. It was, I heard about it.;SC
168564.1;SC;Okay. I just wanted you to know that's the sequence you're in. Okay. At the completion of that, we go back to panel 8, and it's Sequential, Pyro Arm, both of them, to Safe. [Long pause.];CMP
168591.1;CMP;Okay. Panel 8: Seq Pyro Arm, two, to Safe. [Pause.];SC
168603.1;SC; Okay. And following this, we take Sequential, Logic, two, to Off. [Pause.];CMP
168618.1;CMP; Okay. Logic, two, to Off.;SC
168623.1;SC; I'm sorry, Jack. I'll have to ask you to repeat that. [Pause.];CMP
168633.1;CMP;Okay. Panel 8: Seq Logic, two, to Off. Are they On now, Ken? I don't remember turning them - I guess that's part of one of the other sequences, huh? That we turned them On?;SC
168643.1;SC;" That's affirm. The reason we're turning the logic off, Jack, is a power savings. So we'll be turning them off, and I'll be getting them back on when we go to get off of the LM; and then turn them back off, then we'll be turning them on prior to entry. Just so you know what's coming.";CMP
168660.1;CMP; Okay, real fine.;SC
168663.1;SC;Okay. Then following this, the LM will pitch up to acquire the Moon - Excuse me, they're going to pitch up and acquire the Service Module and photograph, and they'll be using the ACA for rotations from now on. And you may see the LM out of window number 5 at the same time they pitch up to acquire it. [Long pause.];CMP
168697.1;CMP;Okay. The LM pitches up, acquires the Service Module and photographs it, and I should expect to find - might possibly see the Service Module out of window 5.;SC
168707.1;SC;That's affirmative. Okay, now we're down to EI minus 3 hours, or the next time-event, and the LM starts a maneuver to what we call the Moon-view attitude. This maneuver is designed to place the Command Module optics pointing with zero zero at the Moon, and it will be flown to on the LM ball angle. [Long pause.];CMP
168752.1;CMP; Okay, the LM maneuvers to the Moon-viewing attitude which would place the Moon in the center of the Command Module optics with them at zero zero.;SC
168763.1;SC;"That's affirmative. Okay, now we're going to panel 5, and it's circuit breaker G&amp;N, Computer, Main B, Closed. [Pause.]";CMP
168776.1;CMP;"Okay. Panel 5: CB G&amp;N, Computer, Main B, Closed.";SC
168790.1;SC;"That's affirmative. Now you're going to come up with a 37 Enter 06 Enter most likely on the computer. And what we want to do is to put the computer to standby; if you come up with a 37 06, you'll have to do an Enter in order to get the code 62. If it's got 62 on it, you can do a Proceed until the DSKY blanks. You might remember that the AC is still off at this time so you won't be getting the Standby status light, and your cue that the computer is indeed in standby is when the DSKY goes blank.";CMP
168831.1;CMP;Okay. You're saying that I will probably get a Program 06 with a Verb 37 Enter flashing.;SC
168842.1;SC; I expect that you - ;CMP
168843.1;CMP;Enter 06.;SC
168844.1;SC; I expect you are...;CMP
168845.1;CMP; Say again, Ken.;SC
168847.1;SC;Yes. We think that you're going to come up with a 37 06 already on the DSKY. If you do, do an Enter and that should take you to the code 00062, which is the request for standby. And when you get that, hit Proceed until the DSKY blanks. If you come up with something else, that's where we want to end up anyhow. With either, when you get the code 62 when it comes up, just do a Proceed on it.;CMP
168880.1;CMP; Okay. Is there anything else I could get?;SC
168887.1;SC; I don't believe so, Jack. That's one that when you get to that step, if you do get something else, we will be standing by to see what you see. The whole scheme is to go to standby.;CMP
168898.1;CMP; Will you be getting it on downlink?;SC
168900.1;SC; No, sir. We don't have that powered up yet.;CMP
168904.1;CMP; Okay. I'll yell to Jim, and Jim will give you a call.;SC
168908.1;SC; Okay. The basic thing, Jack, is just to get the computer in standby to save power.;CMP
168915.1;CMP; Okay.;SC
168916.1;SC; And we need another Battery B readout. [Long pause.];CMP
168931.1;CMP; Okay. He is on his way. Go ahead.;SC

169021.1;SC; Okay, Jack. And that's correct. I got it out of sequence. Would you put that Computer, Main A, ahead of LM Power? [Long pause.];CMP
169046.1;CMP;"Okay, Ken. That's CB G&amp;N, Computer, Main A, Closed, goes before CB LM Power-1 and -2, Open.";SC
169054.1;SC; That's correct. Jack, what we're doing is we've had the LM powering Main B, and we've had all these particular loads on it, and we're getting ready to secure LM power so we wanted to make sure that essential things like the computer, the platform, and all have dioded power supplies before we remove the LM power.;CMP

169788.1;CMP;No, I've got them. They are going to give me a clock Delta, state vector, Verb 66, two REFSMMATs, and an entry target load.;SC
169795.1;SC; That's correct. Okay, and then we'll do...;CMP
169799.1;CMP; There isn't much else they could give me, is there, Ken?;SC
169803.1;SC;"No, not very much. How about IMU powerup according to the G&amp;C checklist, G/2-1. [Long pause.]";CMP
169825.1;CMP;"Okay. Perform IMU powerup per G&amp;C checklist, page 2-1.";SC
169833.1;SC;That's correct. And while you are there, you can do the optics powerup on G/2-3. [Long pause.];CMP
169856.1;CMP;Perform the optics powerup per page 2-3.;SC
169860.1;SC;"That's correct; and on panel 229: circuit breaker Timers, Main A, Closed. [Long pause.]";CMP
169881.1;CMP;Okay. Panel 229: CB Timer, Main A, Closed.;SC
169887.1;SC; That's correct. And the next thing you will do will be to set the mission timer and what we've done is to only turn on the mission timer on the MDC. And you'll probably have to wait here until they get through with the uplink so you can have the computer.;CMP
169905.1;CMP; Okay. Set it from the CMC, huh?;SC
169908.1;SC; That's affirm. Okay. Now, we are getting ready to start the alignment sequence, and are you familiar with the general sequence of events we're going to use, Jack?;CMP
169924.1;CMP;" How do you mean? We are going to make an alignment on the Moon and on the Sun; other than that - I didn't get any - I wasn't on the headset when the general information was passed up, so if there was any more than that, I didn't get it.";SC
169940.1;SC;"Okay. Basically, that is correct. Let me just run through it hand-waving type for a minute, and then I'll read you the steps. I think it will make more sense. The scheme is that the LM can fly to a set of ball angles that will point your optics at the Moon. Now, at any time, in any attitude that we happen to be at, if you can look in the telescope and recognize star patterns sufficient that you believe you can make an alignment all on your own, that's the place we'd like to break off and let you go ahead and take over with your own alignment. However, we are giving you a procedure which will give you things we know you can see in the telescope without worrying about any reflections or anything of that nature, and it's not intended that this procedure has to be followed past the point where you know you've got good definition of star patterns in your telescope. If you need to go on, we'll maneuver, take a look at the Moon, we'll take a mark there, and then we'll maneuver with the LM/FDAI angles again and take a look at the Sun, and get yourself another mark on the Sun and that will complete the alignment. Now, the alignment scheme is that we are going to give you a set of angles that you can coarse align the ball through when the LM is pointing you at the Moon. Now, this set of angles will agree with the REFSMMAT that you have in as a nominal REFSMMAT in your CMC. You can coarse align to that, set a drift flag and REFSMMAT flag, and you'll have a good platform and we'll be within a couple of degrees of a good alignment. And, if we have to, we could break off at this point and go ahead with an entry; however, in an attempt to get a good platform, we are going to have you then do a P52 option 1, and what you are going to find in the option 1 slots is the entry REFSMMAT. You'll come up with the Noun 22 values, and we intend to go ahead and coarse align the ball to the entry REFSMMAT attitude, and then we'll go ahead and take marks through a normal P52 sequence. So that's the general scheme that we are going to use. If you think you have a handle on that, I will go ahead and read you the steps.";CMP
170086.1;CMP;Okay. Well, let me ask a question. The LM maneuvers to a set of Moon-viewing angles. Okay, at this time, I am going to do a P52, is that right? With the planet option?;SC
170104.1;SC;The first thing we are going to do is to coarse align the platform and get it inertial, based on the REFSMMAT that you have in the present slot inside the CMC. We'll then go - and do a P52, option 4 - Correction, option 1.;CMP
170123.1;CMP;Okay - That's after the LM gets established at the attitude. Jim says I'm here at the Moon-viewing attitude, I do a Verb 41 Noun 20 to the set of angles that you're going to give me in the PAD.;SC
170135.1;SC; That's affirmative...;CMP
170136.1;CMP;And then I enter the P52.;SC
170138.1;SC; That's correct.;CMP
170139.1;CMP;Okay. Then I enter the P52 and that's an option 3, right?;SC
170146.1;SC;The P52 will be done as an option 1. The only reason you have the other REFSMMAT inside the computer is that in order to set the REFSMMAT flag, you need some relative orientation.;CMP
170157.1;CMP;Okay. I see. I do a P52 option 1, and when do I set the REFSMMAT flag and the drift flag?;SC
170168.1;SC;That will be before entering P52. I am going to give you this procedure in detail.;CMP
170173.1;CMP; Okay. All right. Let's go at it. Maybe it'll all fall out and I won't have any questions. Go ahead.;SC
170180.1;SC;Okay. I'm ready to start reading again. We start with a Verb 41 Noun 20. [Long pause.];CMP
170203.1;CMP;Okay. When the LM is in the Moon-viewing attitude, I do a Verb 41 Noun 20, Enter.;SC
170209.1;SC;"That's right. And you'll put in the attitudes that you'll get from one of the PADs, and this will be for the coarse align angles when the LM is at the Moon-viewing attitude. Then when they're all squared away, I tell you they have the right attitude; we then pick up again with a Verb 40 Noun 20, Enter. [Long pause.]";CMP
170240.1;CMP;Okay. Verb 40 Noun 20, Enter when Moon is - the LM is satisfied that they're at the Moon-viewing attitude.;SC
170248.1;SC;"That's correct. Now we're going to set the REFSMMAT and drift flags according to the G&amp;C checklist, page G/7-1, steps 3 and 4. [Pause.]";CMP
170270.1;CMP;"Okay. Set the REFSMMAT flag for G&amp;C 7-1, steps 3 and 4.";SC
170275.1;SC;"That's correct. Now Verb 37, Enter; 52, Enter; option 1. [Pause.]";CMP
170288.1;CMP;"Verb 37, Enter; 52, Enter; option 1.";SC
170291.1;SC; That's correct. And we'll do the coarse align. [Pause.];CMP
170304.1;CMP; Okay. Perform the coarse align function.;SC
170308.1;SC; Okay. Now when it gets back to the mark routines, we want to take a mark on the Moon. [Pause.];CMP
170321.1;CMP; Okay. Mark on the Moon with the crosshairs in the center. Is that right?;SC
170325.1;SC;" That's affirmative. Okay. When that's complete, the LM will maneuver to the Sun-viewing angle for attitude. And when they get there, you take a mark on the Sun using the Sun filter and the telescope; and, again, we're marking on the center.";CMP
170354.1;CMP; Okay. Now, let me ask you a question. Is the first mark on the Moon made with the - are all these made with the telescope and not the sextant?;SC
170364.1;SC;" If - I'm not sure right offhand what the angular size of the Moon is, Jack. If you can get it in the sextant; that's the best thing to do, but you may have to go into the telescope in order to define the center. Either one's acceptable.";CMP
170379.1;CMP; Okay. If I can define the center through the sextant, do it that way. And if I can't, use the telescope.;SC
170385.1;SC; That's affirmed. We know you're going to use the telescope on the Sun. [Pause.];CMP
170398.1;SC; Okay. You ready to press on?;CMP
170404.1;CMP; I'm ready.;SC
170405.1;SC; Okay. Just reminded we owe somebody a Bat B voltage.;CMP
170412.1;CMP; Okay, another volts and amps coming up.;SC
170415.1;SC;All right. Thank you. And this left us in P52 with two marks, and we'll go ahead and torque the Noun 93s. [Long pause.];CMP
170438.1;CMP;Okay. [Garbled] torque the Noun 93s, after the two marks.;SC
170443.1;SC; Okay. So that gives us a good platform. Now the LM will maneuver to the jettison attitude, and the only thing of significance here is that you want to watch to make sure that the path they choose to go to the jettison attitude avoids gimbal lock on your own platform. [Long pause.];CMP
170473.1;CMP; Okay. The LM maneuvers to the jettison attitude and I just monitor the maneuver and yell at Jim if he gets near a gimbal lock.;SC
170481.1;SC; That's affirmed. Okay, and then the LM will go to a Max dead band attitude hold in the jettison attitude. [Long pause.];CMP
170499.1;SC; Okay. The LM goes to Max dead band attitude hold.;CMP
170504.1;SC; Okay. Now we're ready to go back to work. The next thing we'll do is to continue to powerup procedures. Do you have any further questions on that alignment, Jack?;CMP
170513.1;CMP; No. No. I think - I think it's all self-explanatory now.;SC
170518.1;SC;" Okay. The one thing that everybody would like for you to understand is we certainly don't insist on using the Moon and the Earth; if you find you have good stars, why use them. However, this alignment is more than adequate to give us a good guided entry.";CMP
170535.1;CMP;Okay. If I get a set of good stars, do I start right out to a basic P51 and a P52 option 1?;SC
170545.1;SC; That's affirmative.;CMP
170548.1;CMP; Okay.;SC
170550.1;SC;Okay. Now, we're ready to go to work on panel 275. And it starts with a circuit breaker Main A...;CMP
170556.1;CMP; Wait - wait just a minute. Wait just a minute. I owe you some volts and amps.;SC
170561.1;SC; Okay. All right.;CMP
170564.1;CMP;Okay. Volts are 39.4, amps, 1.25.;SC
170570.1;SC; Okay. I thought maybe your meter was stuck before.;CMP
170575.1;CMP; No. [Laughter.];SC
170579.1;SC;All right. You ready to go back to 275? Have a circuit breaker Main A, Bat Bus A, Closed. [Long pause.];CMP
170597.1;CMP; CB Main A, Bat Bus A, Closed.;SC
170600.1;SC; That's correct. And circuit breaker Main B, Bat C, Closed. [Pause.];CMP
170612.1;CMP; CB Main Baker, Bat Charlie, Closed.;SC
170615.1;SC;Okay. That's correct. Now we're up to EI minus 1 plus 30. And at this time, we're going to proceed with the closeout and hatch installation. [Long pause.];CMP
170645.1;CMP;Okay. Closeout and hatch installation at EI minus 01:30.;SC
170650.1;SC; That's right, Jack, and we're going to close the LM hatch, and we'll make the dump valve in the LM hatch closed.;CMP
170666.1;CMP; Understand you're going to close the dump valve, now on the LM hatch, right?;SC
170671.1;SC; That's correct.;CMP
170672.1;CMP; Okay. This is a change from what we had understood previously.;SC
170676.1;SC; That's correct.;CMP
170678.1;CMP; I'm - Personally, I'm happy to see it, but that's good.;SC
170681.1;SC;" Okay. That's one vote on your side. Okay; and we're going to go ahead and do the - use the decal to perform the hatch installation, and we'll start on the hatch integrity check. [Long pause.]";CMP
170714.1;CMP;" Okay. Per the decal, perform the hatch installation and start on the hatch integrity check.	";SC
170724.1;SC; That's correct.;CMP
170728.1;CMP; Okay, Ken. One thing I think that - I don't know whether anybody - the decal don't take into account the fact that we still have the umbilicals connected. At what point in time should they be removed?;SC
170745.1;SC; Okay, Jack. That doesn't matter. We're going to be separating the tunnel upstream of those umbilicals, and you can leave them right there. [Pause.];CMP
170759.1;CMP;Okay. Does it make any difference if we disengage - the LM - We have pulled the circuit breakers LM Power-1 and -2, so if we choose to disconnect these umbilicals, there's no harm, right?;SC
170776.1;SC; That's right. No sweat. John Aaron's just saying that they may be hot. He's checking on it, so how about holding a decision on that and let me come back to you?;CMP
170789.1;CMP; Okay.;SC
170794.1;SC;Okay. And let me tell you what we're going to do since we told you a different story this afternoon on this tunnel. We're actually going to vent the tunnel down so that we end up with about 1Â½ to 2 psi absolute in the tunnel. And this will give us a Delta-P of 3. So we'll do our hatch integrity check at the same time we're venting the tunnel down.;CMP
170819.1;CMP; Okay. It sounds good.;SC
170821.1;SC; Okay. Now let me give you some plumbing switches here. Let's take the Surge Tank Oxygen valve to On. [Long pause.];CMP
170840.1;CMP;Surge Tank O<sub>2</sub> to On.;SC
170843.1;SC; All right. Take the Main Regs, two, Open. [Pause.];CMP
170854.1;CMP; Main Regs, two, to Open.;SC
170857.1;SC; Okay. And the Water And Glycol Tank Pressure, the Pressure valve and the Relief valve to Both. [Long pause.];CMP
170875.1;CMP; Okay, Water And Glycol Tanks Pressure and Relief valve to Both.;SC
170881.1;SC; That's correct. And Emergency Cabin Pressure valve to Both. [Long pause.];CMP
170895.1;CMP; Emergency Cabin Pressure to Both.;SC
170898.1;SC;" That's correct; and the Suit Demand Regs to Both. [Pause.]";CMP
170910.1;CMP; Suit Demand Regs to Both.;SC
170913.1;SC;That's correct. Okay, now we're going to panel 5: circuit breaker ECS Transducers, Pressure Group 1 and 2, Main A and Main B. That's four circuit breakers, Closed. [Long pause.];CMP
170941.1;CMP;ECS Transducers, Group 1 and 2, Main A and Main B, four, to Close.;SC
170947.1;SC; That's correct. Okay, now. Circuit breaker ECS Transducer, Temperature, Main A and Main B, that's two of them, Closed. [Pause.];CMP
170966.1;CMP; CB ECS Transducer, Temperature, Main A and Main B, Closed.;SC
170972.1;SC;That's correct. On panel 4: Primary ECS Glycol Pumps, one, to AC 1. [Pause.];CMP
170988.1;CMP;Primary ECS Glycol Pumps to 1, AC1.;SC
170992.1;SC;That's correct. Okay, then we'll finish going back to the tunnel vent, and verify the LM/CM Delta-P and make sure it's been holding pressure. And we'll come back again and rehash all of the hatch integrity check and tunnel vent procedures with you. The next thing I want to read off is the EI minus 1 plus 20. We'll go to panel 7: BMAG number 1 Power to Warm Up. [Pause.];CMP
171046.1;CMP;BMAG number 1 Power to Warm Up.;SC
171050.1;SC;That's correct. Then at EI minus 1 plus 10, we'll perform SCS powerup per checklist, page G/2-4. [Pause.];CMP
171070.1;CMP;"Okay. Perform SCS powerup per G&amp;C checklist, page 2-4.";SC
171077.1;SC;That's correct. Okay, on panel 4: Suit Compressor Number 2 to AC1. [Pause.];CMP
171093.1;CMP;Suit Compressor 2 to AC1.;SC
171096.1;SC; That's correct. Spacecraft Control to SCS. [Long pause.];CMP
171115.1;CMP; Spacecraft Control to SCS.;SC
171118.1;SC; Okay. And your Manual Attitude switches, as you desire. We're coming up on jettison of the LM, so that's just like separation.;CMP
171137.1;CMP; Okay.;SC
171139.1;SC; Okay. And we'll do a GDC align. [Long pause.];CMP
171156.1;CMP; Okay. Perform a GDC align.;SC
171158.1;SC;Okay. On panel 8: Rotation Control Power, Direct, 1 and 2, Main A/Main B. [Long pause.];CMP
171184.1;CMP;Okay. These are circuit breakers, Rotation Control Power, Direct, 1 and 2, Main A and Main B, Closed? [Pause.];SC
171197.1;SC; Okay, Jack. I wasn't thinking switch. Let me verify that's a circuit breaker, too. I think we have to get both of them.;CMP
171207.1;CMP;Okay, there's those four circuit breakers over there, Ken. When you said panel 8, that's what I thought you were talking about. I don't think the circuit breakers are out right now, but why don't we just put - verify the circuit breakers and put the switches to Main A/Main B.;SC
171232.1;SC;"Okay, that's correct, Jack. Okay, at EI minus 1 hour, we're going to be doing the LM jettison; so just prior to that, we want to do a P47. [Pause.]";CMP
171262.1;CMP;Okay, say at about 1 minute prior to LM jettison, huh?;SC
171270.1;SC; Yes, just something that's comfortable for you. [Pause.];CMP
171282.1;CMP; Okay.;SC
171283.1;SC;All right, after we've done that, we want to get panel 8, Sequential, Pyro Arm, two of them, On. [Long pause.];CMP
171300.1;CMP; Okay. I get a Go fron MSFN for this?;SC
171307.1;SC; Okay, John says we can watch it. [Pause.];CMP
171318.1;CMP; Okay.;SC
171319.1;SC;" All right; the next thing is CSM/LM Final Sep, two of them, On, up. [Long pause.]";CMP
171334.1;CMP; CSM/LM Final Sep, two, On.;SC
171337.1;SC;That's correct. Now we're going back to panel 8, and it's Sequential, Pyro Arm, two of them, to Safe. [Long pause.];CMP
171363.1;CMP; Okay. Seq Pyro Arm, two, to Safe.;SC
171366.1;SC;That's correct, and go back to P00. [Pause.];CMP
171377.1;CMP;Okay. Go to P00.;SC
171379.1;SC; All right. And now it's time to configure for single ring. [Long pause.];CMP
171395.1;CMP; Okay. Configure for single ring RCS.;SC
171398.1;SC; That's right, and since you're still an hour from EI, I guess it wouldn't hurt to use Minimum Impulse or something like that rather than the DAP, at least not until you get closer down. We'll have the DAP loads for you later. [Long pause.];CMP
171420.1;CMP; [Garbled] - Okay.;SC
171421.1;SC; Okay. And as soon as you've gotten yourself all set up with a good control mode, you want to maneuver to the entry attitude. [Pause.];CMP
171440.1;CMP; Maneuver to entry attitude per the PAD.;SC
171442.1;SC;That's correct. And we show EI minus 55, which really means when you get to the entry attitude, we have a sextant star check for you. And that will be on the PAD. [Pause.];CMP
171466.1;CMP; Okay. Perform a sextant star check.;SC
171469.1;SC;Okay. And I want to remind you to park the optics at 90 degrees of shaft. [Pause.];CMP
171475.1;CMP; Okay. Say again why, Ken. I didn't understand that.;SC
171486.1;SC;Okay, this is just a precaution, Jack. If we park the optics with a 90-degree shaft angle, that will line up the slits so it gives you the best airflow over that part of the heat shield and avoids a hot spot. If you don't remember it, I don't think it makes much difference. It's just good procedure.;CMP
171507.1;CMP; Okay.;SC
171510.1;SC; Okay. And after you've got it parked wherever you want it, well, turn the Optics Power Off and stow the optics. [Long pause.];CMP
171529.1;CMP;" Okay. Optics Power, Off; stow the optics.";SC
171532.1;SC;Okay, that's good, Okay. The next thing we'll do is to initialize the EMS and that's on entry checklist page 2-1, step number 2. [Pause.];CMP
171555.1;CMP;Okay, perform EMS initialization per entry checklist page 2-1, step 2.;SC
171561.1;SC;Okay, that's correct. Now we're coming up on EI minus 45 minutes, and we'll give you an entry PAD and a final state vector. [Long pause.];CMP
171587.1;CMP;Okay, at minus 45, entry PAD and final state vector from MSFN.;SC
171592.1;SC;" Okay. Now we're going to perform what we call the Moon check. Rather than go into detail, if you already know what we're doing just say so; otherwise, I'll describe the use of the Moon-attitude set. [Pause.]";CMP
171613.1;CMP; Maybe you better describe it.;SC
171616.1;SC;"Okay, Jack. You remember everybody in the past has commented on seeing Moonset just a couple minutes prior to EI, and your horizon will probably be dark at the time that you get there; you're having an early morning entry; and coming in from the west, you'll still be looking at a dark horizon. So, just as a backup technique, just like you would track the horizon, we're going to give you an attitude which will be on the PAD so that you can look directly at the Moon. This is an inertial attitude; it won't be changing, and you'll put the 36-degree window line on the Moon, and then just sit there and watch it. And just prior to EI, the Earth will come up and occult it, and you will then have a good horizon check. And I have some times, and I'll give you that later. And if you just look at this thing now, at that point you can set the GDC or whatever you desire. And you will have a known attitude reference. It's just like a horizon check. [Pause.]";CMP
171682.1;CMP;"Okay, I maneuver to the Moon check attitude; at which time I put the 36 window line on the Moon, and just prior to EI, the Earth will occult the Moon.";SC
171698.1;SC;" That's correct. And that corresponds to the same inertial attitude that you'd have on the back of your entry card where it shows the horizon attitude several minutes prior to EI; it's the same thing.";CMP
171716.1;CMP;Yes, that's that one at 17 minutes prior. Okay.;SC
171719.1;SC;"Okay, and we're just getting it in a little closer. Okay, the next item on the check - checklist here is an EI minus 40; we're going to panel 7, and it's BMAG Number 2 Power to Warm Up. [Long pause.]";CMP
171744.1;CMP;Okay, panel 7: BMAG Number 2 Power to Warm Up.;SC
171747.1;SC; That's correct. Now, I'd like to verify the Surge Tank and Repress Packages are On.  [Long pause.];CMP
171768.1;CMP; Verify Surge Tank and Repress Package are On.;SC
171771.1;SC;"That's correct. On panel 5: circuit breaker Environmental - Control System; Waste Water/Urine Dump Heater, two of them, Closed. [Long pause.]";CMP
171799.1;CMP;Panel 5: CB ECS, Waste H<sub>2</sub>O/Urine Dump Heaters, two, to Close.;SC
171806.1;SC;That's correct. Suit Compressor number 2 to Off. [Long pause.];CMP
171822.1;CMP;Suit Compressor 2 to Off.;SC
171824.1;SC;"That's right, Jack, and what this - what we're planning to do in order to conserve power is we're going to run the suit compressor from an hour to this point at minus 40. And we'll be watching the PCO<sub>2</sub>; if that thing's working, we'll turn it off at the earliest time that we have a good cabin, and then we'll just leave it off. And in the event that the PCO<sub>2</sub> gauge isn't working properly or something like that, well, we'll just go ahead and run it for this time frame.";CMP
171855.1;CMP; Okay, that sounds good.;SC
171858.1;SC;All right. Now we're at EI minus 30. Sequential, Logic, that's two of them, to On, up. [Pause.];CMP
171872.1;CMP;"EI minus 30; Seq, Logic, two, On.";SC
171876.1;SC;Okay, in panel 7: the BMAG number 2 Power to On. [Pause.];CMP
171888.1;CMP;Okay, we - you only gave that 10 minutes for the warmup, huh?;SC
171893.1;SC; That's okay.;CMP

171911.1;SC; Okay. And we want to activate the primary evaporator. [Long pause.];CMP
171929.1;CMP; Okay, activate the primary evaporator. All this time, Ken, what we've been getting our cooling? Right now, I think we have the radiators at Pull To Bypass.;SC
171938.1;SC;" That's correct. We started out that way, and we turned the glycol pumps on, and we're just circulating it internally. And we're counting on the Command Module being a heat sink; it's pretty cold soaked, and it looks like this is good enough. You got some relatively low heat loads...";CMP
171955.1;CMP; Okay.;SC
171956.1;SC; ...and we'll keep watching the temps, and if we need it, why we'll start the evaporator early.;CMP
171962.1;CMP; Okay, that sounds good.;SC
171964.1;SC; Do you believe it's cold up there?;CMP
171968.1;CMP; Yes, and we used to call the Command Module the bedroom and it's now the refrigerator.;SC
171973.1;SC;Okay, just don't call it the freezer. Okay. At about EI minus 19, we get back into the standard entry checklist on page 2-2, where it starts with P61. [Long pause.];CMP
171999.1;CMP;Okay, at EI minus 19, we get back into the entry checklist at page 2-2, where we start entering P61.;SC
172009.1;SC; Okay, Jack. Now that's the - those are the timeline notes I had for you. I hate to tell you this, but I also have a couple of corrections to make to the entry checklist. They aren't corrections, they just are pieces of the entry checklist which will correspond to what I've written - already read to you. And I'm ready to go on that whenever you are. And Vance tells me you can get into the descent water for drinking now.;CMP
172037.1;CMP; We can get into the descent water for drinking, huh?;SC
172040.1;SC; Aha.;CMP
172042.1;CMP; Sounds good.;SC
172043.1;CAPCOM; Hey, go to it.;CMP
172049.1;CMP; Jim would like to know whether the descent water will be good until LM jettison? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
172074.1;SC;Okay, Jack. Looks like we're going to go on the ascent tanks at 128:30. And it looks like...;CMP
172084.1;CMP; Okay, understand. We are going...;SC
172085.1;SC;" ...you have plenty of water. I'm sorry we cut each other out; say again.";CMP
172089.1;CMP;Okay, yes. I was going to say, understand we're going to go on the ascent tanks at 128:30.;SC
172095.1;SC;" That's right; based on the current rate, that's what they predict and you can go ahead and drink the water. No sweat.";CMP
172103.1;CMP;" Okay, real fine. And I've got the entry checklist out and I'm ready to copy; just give me the page.";SC
172109.1;SC; Okay.;CAPCOM
172111.1;CAPCOM; Jack, you're starting to sound like an LMP. [Pause.];SC
172119.1;CMP; I think I'm probably the only CMP that's ever witnessed an - a LM burn from inside the LM in - in space flight.;SC
172129.1;SC;(Laughter) I hope it stays that way. Okay, Jack, we're starting on page 1-1.;CMP
172136.1;CMP; Go ahead.;SC
172138.1;SC;"Okay, down in the middle of the page on line 9, we're just going to strike out the ""Activate VHF for Comm checks,"" and line 10, ""Verify the DSE."" We're going to leave the DSE Off, and that's to save power, as is the VHF activation.";CMP
172157.1;CMP; Okay.;SC
172160.1;SC;"Okay, on page 1-2. At minus 2 hours, there's a title ""Logic sequence"" check; and we're deleting that entire sequence; that's included in what I read up to you.";CMP
172178.1;CMP;Okay, delete the logic sequence check at minus 2 hours there.;SC
172184.1;SC;That's correct. And delete lines 23, 24, and 25. That means a maneuver to Supercirc entry attitude. Everything below that is deleted. [Long pause.];CMP
172208.1;CMP;Okay. Delete lines 23 through 28.;SC
172213.1;SC;That's correct. You got ahead of me. All right, on line 29 on page 1-3, we're going to put in a time of minus 00:55. That's the time we gave you for the boresight check.;CMP
172230.1;CMP; Okay...;SC
172231.1;SC; That's your sextant check, really. [Pause.];CMP
172240.1;CMP; Got that.;SC
172241.1;SC;"Okay, on the top of page 1-4; where it said ""1 hour and 15 minutes"" next to line 32, we're going to change that to ""Minus 2 hours and 30 minutes"".";CMP
172257.1;CMP;Okay, minus 02:30 opposite item 32.;SC
172260.1;SC;" Okay, down at the bottom of the EMS entry check right there where we are, the bottom line now reads, ""EMS Mode to Standby."" Well, just above that - like to remind you to put a remark, ""Do not initialize the range to go."" This is because you're going to come into the EMS entry check, you're going to run through all these things; then we're going to remove power from the EMS. And just didn't want you to get ahead of yourself and initialize the entry parameters, because you'll lose them when we power up. [Pause.]";CMP
172294.1;CMP; Okay.;SC
172295.1;SC;" And, after we go EMS Mode to Standby, like for you to add ""Circuit breaker EMS, two, to Open."" [Pause.]";CMP
172314.1;CMP;" Okay, ""CB EMS, two, to Open"".";SC
172316.1;SC;"That's correct. And we want to delete this ""Set up camera"" that's listed on the bottom of the page. We're deleting that for power reasons. That's line 33 Alpha.";CMP
172329.1;CMP; Okay, we're way ahead of you. We already got it stowed.;SC
172334.1;SC;"Okay. On the top of the next page where it says ""Secondary water EVAP,"" just keep in mind we don't plan to use the secondary evaporators unless the primary fails. On line 35 on page 1-5, next to ""Command Module RCS preheat,"" the time is now ""Minus 06:30."" [Pause.]";CMP
172369.1;CMP;"Okay, ""minus 06:30,"" and the voltage reading 3.9 still is good, right?";SC
172376.1;SC;"Okay, very good. Under ""Final stowage,"" the first thing that's listed on line 36, page 1-5, is ""Optics."" And if you want to get started on your stowage, we'd like to leave the optics out, because we'll have the star check coming up quite a bit after this. The rest of that stuff can be taken care of at your convenience. [Pause.]";CMP
172402.1;CMP; Okay.;SC
172403.1;SC;"All right, still on page 1-5, line 37; the time is now ""Minus 06:10."" [Pause.]";CMP
172418.1;CMP; Got that.;SC
172420.1;SC;Okay, and this is one time it looks like we might actually do the preheat, so that's the reason we want to make sure that we know that not more than 20 minutes of time on the preheat. We may not be able to watch it at that time because you aren't powered up. [Long pause.];CMP
172449.1;CMP;Okay. Either 20 minutes or until 3.9 volts DC.;SC
172453.1;SC;"That's correct, Jack. And now let's go to page 1-6. And about one-third of the way down, it shows ""Panel 275 CB Main A, Bat C, Closed,"" we want to strike off that line, the next two lines, and we're going to strike out ""Main A, Bat C, Closed; Main B, Bat C, Closed;"" and ""DC Indicator, Main B.""";CMP
172486.1;CMP;"Okay. After that step on panel 275, strike out ""CB Main A, Bat C; CB Main B, Bat C""; and ""DC Indicators to Main B"".";SC
172497.1;SC;"That's correct. Now under panel 8, it tells you to ""Close all circuit breakers except,"" and I have four additions. The first one is CB Service Module RCS Heaters, Quad Charlie, Main B, open. [Long pause.]";CMP
172525.1;CMP; Service Module RCS Heaters, Quad Charlie, Main Baker, open. ;SC
172530.1;SC; Okay. And the same thing for Service Module RCS Heater, Quad Delta, Main A, open. [Pause.];CMP
172546.1;CMP; Service Module RCS Heaters, Quad Delta, Main A, open.;SC
172550.1;SC; That's correct. And Circuit breaker EMS, that's two of them, open. [Long pause.];CMP
172569.1;CMP; CB EMS, two, to open.;SC
172571.1;SC; All right. And the last is the circuit breakers for SPS GAGING, four of them, open. [Long pause.];CMP
172589.1;CMP; SPS GAGING, four to open.;SC
172593.1;SC; Okay. And how about our readout on the battery and that charger?;CMP
172600.1;CMP; Okay, Bat's at volts and amps.;SC
172604.1;SC;"That's affirmed. And let's go back to page 1-6, line 41. Let's put in a time ""Minus 04:40"".";CMP
172615.1;CMP;Minus 04:40.;SC
172617.1;SC;"That's correct. On page 2-1, line number 2, put in a time of ""Minus 55 minutes"".";CMP
172639.1;CMP;Okay, minus 55 minutes.;SC
172642.1;SC;" Okay. And the first thing you want to do under ""EMS initialization,"" is circuit breakers EMS, that's two of them, to Close.";CMP
172656.1;CMP; Okay. CB EMS, two, to Close.;SC
172659.1;SC;"That's correct. All right. Line 4 or step 4, where it shows ""CM RCS check."" That occurs at minus 04:30. [Pause.]";CMP
172672.1;CMP;Okay. Minus 04:30.;SC
172675.1;SC;" All right. Under ""CM RCS checks,"" the fourth line down says ""Manual Attitude, three, to Minimum Impulse."" We'll have to use ""Accel Command"" and the reason for that, Jack, is we don't have the SPS powered up so there's no minimum impulse generator.";CMP
172694.1;CMP; Okay. Manual Attitude, three, to Accel Command.;SC
172697.1;SC;"That's correct. And on the same page 2-1, strike out the last three lines, starting with ""RCS transfer to Service Module."" [Pause.]";CMP
172712.1;CMP; Right. The last three lines are scratched out. We ain't got one of those things.;SC
172717.1;SC;That's correct. Okay, let's flip to page 2-2 and strike out the first two lines.;CMP
172726.1;CMP; Okay. Now wait a second. I need to give you volts and amps, Ken.;SC
172729.1;SC; All right. Go ahead.;CMP
172734.1;CMP;Okay. It's 39.6, 1.12.;SC
172740.1;SC;"Sounds like you're getting there. Okay. I believe we scratched out the first two lines on 2-2. Now, we're - right below that, it says ""Separation checklist."" So we're going to just delete that whole thing; it's included in the notes I gave you. [Pause.]";CMP
172765.1;CMP; Okay. It's included in the notations.;SC
172770.1;SC;"All right. Line number 7. It says ""Maneuver to horizon check attitude."" We're going to call this the ""Moon-check attitude"" and this is the one we discussed, Jack. The angle of 265 is not correct. I'll have one of those for you first thing in the morning.";CMP
172790.1;CMP; Okay.;SC
172791.1;SC;Okay. And at the bottom of the page, step number 1. That will be at EI minus 19 minutes, and we're off and running through a normal sequence of events. [Pause.];CMP
172807.1;CMP; Okay. That sounds good. Ken, I guess if you've read this thing - Is it a comfortable time line? Any areas where you had problems with?;SC
172817.1;SC; Jack, it is very comfortable. We've run it several times now and, in fact, it's being run right now, again. And we've run it both here at Houston and at the Cape. The only place where you might find that you need to stay ahead of things is during the platform-alignment period, when you're getting ready to close out the LM and then once you get into the Command Module and jettison the LM, why you're back on a very comfortable time. And, of course, we'll be watching and anything we can do, like keeping track of time for you, we'll remind you of that as we go along.;CAPCOM
172851.1;CMP; Hey, that would be good - that would be good, Ken.;SC
172857.1;SC;"Okay. Let me emphasize, Jack, that 2Â½ hours is the earliest time we can start in on that powerup stuff. Everything else you can do the way you normally would, where you get as far ahead of the game as you can. But the 2Â½- hour time is based on saving Command Module consumables. And if you do that, why we're fat; we've got plenty of time to give you some fans on the water even. So that's the one point you don't want to start early on. I do have a couple of more lines to run through on the entry checklist and two pages in the G&amp;C. And I think that will clean us up. [Long pause.]";CMP
172909.1;CMP;" Okay, Ken. And G&amp;C checklist now?";SC
172912.1;SC; Let me finish a couple more things in the entry book. You still got that?;CMP
172918.1;CMP; Yes. Go ahead.;SC
172919.1;SC;"Okay. On - These are just cleanup items, Jack. On page 2-3, it lists how you separate, from the CM/SM Sep and all that, so, obviously, if we're on step 5 at 43 minutes down - that's all deleted. And that gets deleted all the way over onto page 2-4, up to the line where it says ""15 minutes."" And at that point, we pick back up and everything. From 15 minutes down is valid. [Long pause.]";CMP
172962.1;CMP;"Okay. Delete item 5 down to the point where it says ""Minus 15 minutes.""";SC
172969.1;SC;"That's correct, Jack. Okay, on page 2-5. The top line where we had ""Horizon check,"" that's now the ""Moonset check"" and the time is approximately 57:37. And that's minus 02:23. And that angle that's listed in the book there - 177 - that's really a horizon time at 2 minutes; we'll have you - can look that up on the back of your entry cue card, and I'll look that number up again for you tonight.";CMP
173015.1;CMP; Okay.;SC
173016.1;SC;"Okay. Another thing is to remember when we begin blackout, which is around 0.05 g, and you can write this in your checklist wherever it's convenient; once we've lost Comm, we're going to go ahead and power down the SCE Power Off and the PMP Power Off. And we just want to do that after you lose Comm, which comes up around EI. Any time after that, go ahead and secure the PMP and the SCE power. [Long pause.]";CMP
173057.1;CMP; Okay. When Comm is lost, SCE Power Off, PMP Power Off.;SC
173062.1;SC;" That's correct, Jack, and that completes the entry checklist. Let's look at the G&amp;C book. [Long pause.]";CMP
173081.1;CMP; Okay. Ready to copy.;SC
173083.1;SC;Okay. Let's go to page 2-1. [Long pause.];CMP
173100.1;CMP; Okay. Go ahead.;SC
173102.1;SC;"Okay, Jack. The second line under ""IMU powerup"" says ""FDAI Power to Both,"" and we're going to make that a ""1."" The reason we're doing that is, again, to conserve power. There's no reason to drive the second FDAI before we get that information to put on it.";CMP
173123.1;CMP;"Okay. ""FDAI Power to 1"".";SC
173128.1;SC;All right. That's correct. On page 2-2. [Pause.];CMP
173141.1;CMP; Go ahead.;SC
173142.1;SC;"Okay. Under CMC powerup, line - or step 2 says ""Flashing 3700, Enter."" The time we're going to use this, Jack, is going to be when you've just brought the computer up and it has a state vector in it that's way back many, many hours ago. So we want to do a Verb 96, Enter to stop the integration to keep it from just sitting there ambling along. And when the ground gives you a new state vector, why then we can go through P00 and we'll be back in business.  [Pause.]";CMP
173178.1;CMP;"Okay. You want me to go to Verb 37, Enter; 00, Enter; and then do Verb 96?";SC
173190.1;SC;When you come up, I guess you're going to - once you get the CMC powered up, you're probably going to be going - you're going to come up in a flashing 37, and if you'll just do a Verb 96, Enter right there, that will take care of it.;CMP
173203.1;CMP; Okay.;SC
173204.1;SC;All right. And the last one I have for you is on page 2-4. [Pause.];CMP
173218.1;CMP; Okay. Go ahead.;SC
173219.1;SC;"Okay. Under the SCS powerup, the first line says ""Auto RCS Select, 16, to Off."" Okay. You can just delete that part. On the fifth line, it says ""Circuit breaker SCS Logic Power,"" that's really ""Logic Bus, four of them, to Closed."" The Delta-V CG is not important since we are not burning the engine. The ""Signal Conditioner/Driver Bias Power"" lists ""Two to AC 1."" We are going to make that just one of them; make it ""Signal Condition/Driver Bias Power, one, to AC 1."" The ""BMAG Power,"" which is the third line from the bottom, says ""BMAG Power, two, On;"" we are going to make that just one. We'll bring up number 1, and we'll make ""FDAI Power, number 1"" and the last line ""Auto RCS Select, 16, enable,"" you can strike that off and replace it with ""BMAG Mode, three of them, to Rate 1."" You want to try reading that back? [Long pause.]";CMP
173313.1;CMP;"Okay. Delete ""Auto RCS Select, 16, Off."" Change ""CB Logic Power"" to ""Logic Thrust Power - CBS CS Logic Thrust, four, to Closed."" Delete ""Delta-V CG,"" coming down here ""Signal Conditioner/Driver Bias Power, one, AC 1; BMAG Power, 1, to On,"" and it's the number 1 BMAG. ""FDAI Power to 1; BMAG Mode, three, to Rate 1,"" deleting the ""Auto RCS Select, 16, to enable"".";SC
173349.1;SC; That's correct. You've got them all, Jack. Very good. Thank you.;CMP
173355.1;CMP; Thank you. This does it, huh? ;SC
173358.1;SC;" Yes, sir. Let's see - just a second - let me check on this hatch and integrity check; maybe I can tell you something about that. And I do have an answer to your LM power question about the umbilicals. The umbilicals will be unpowered according to the LM procedures, so if you'd like to disconnect them, you can.";CMP
173379.1;CMP; Okay. I think we will.;SC
173381.1;SC; All right, sir. Okay, Jack, and they'd like us to stand by just a second.;CMP
173394.1;CAPCOM; Jack, would you get the Battery Charger, Off, please. And we'll send you...;CMP
173399.1;CMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
173400.1;CAPCOM; ...the rest of that procedure later.;CMP
173401.1;CMP; You mean there's more? Okay, in work. Battery Charger is going Off. ;CAPCOM
173408.1;CAPCOM; Right.;CMP
173409.1;CMP; Okay, Vance. Okay - I don't think you've given me the backout procedure, have you, for the battery chargers?;CAPCOM
173418.1;CAPCOM; That's negative. Wait. All we want to do, Jack, is say Battery Charge Off at the moment. We'll complete that procedure as soon as you are through with Ken completely. [Long pause.];CMP
173436.1;CMP; Okay, Vance. The Battery Charger's Off, and I'm ready to continue with Ken.;CAPCOM
173441.1;CAPCOM; Okay, Jack. And we'll get the backout to you after that.;SC
173448.1;SC; Okay, Jack. It looks like we've closed up the loose ends here. Amazingly enough, out of all that stuff, it looks like we only generated one question on the floor, and we'll research that one. We'll even let you guess what it might have been. If you have any questions, after you mull it over, why, we're always available. Just ask us what you're thinking about.;CAPCOM
173535.1;CMP; Okay. That's what we're going to do. We're going to wait until the LM people get theirs, and then we're going to discuss it and coordinate things here, and make sure that - that we don't have any interface problems. And, if we have any more questions, we'll be coming back at you.;SC
173550.1;SC; Okay. We did run the thing integrated, so we think we've got all the little surprises ironed out for you.;CMP
173559.1;CMP; I hope so because tomorrow is examination time.;SC

173564.1;CDR; Ken, this is Jim.;SC
173566.1;SC; Yes, sir.;CDR
173567.1;CDR; Appreciate the work you've done, and Jack says that it's going to be hard to beat his record about saving SM RCS fuel all the way there and back.;SC
173577.1;SC; I can't do much about that.;CDR
173580.1;SC; Some people will do anything to set a record.;CDR
173587.1;SC; Hey, Jim, you even did good on Service Module fuel this time.;CMP
173595.1;CMP; Yes. We're coming back with full load almost of both RCS and SPS, that's - That's pretty much of a record. [Pause.];CAPCOM
173611.1;CMP; Okay. Did you want to put Freddo on, or somebody to copy the LM - the LM side of the house. [Pause.];CAPCOM
173623.1;CAPCOM;Hey, Jack. Don't wake him up yet. Stand by 1.;CMP

173939.1;CDR;" Okay, Vance. Descent Water valve, Closed; Ascent Water valve, Closed; and Water Select Tank to Ascent. Is that correct?";CAPCOM
173949.1;CAPCOM; Water Tank Select valve, Ascent. That's correct, Jim. [Pause.];CDR
173960.1;CDR; And we'll proceed with that right now, and how about still drinking descent water? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
173987.1;CAPCOM; Jim, we understand that you should be able to continue drinking it. [Pause.];CDR
173999.1;CDR; Okay. We switched to ascent water, but we'll probably have to have the descent water valve back open up again to drink water.;CAPCOM
174009.1;CAPCOM; That's affirm. That's the one thing you'll have to do is, whenever you want to drink out of the descent tank, is open the descent valve - the Descent Water valve momentarily.;CDR

178914.8;CAPCOM;Okay, Jack. The time line between EI minus 02:30 and 1 hour is real crowded, so you're really going to have to hustle, and we've decided to delete the EMS entry check at minus 02:30. That'll give you a little more time in there. What we've decided to do with it is wait until after EI minus 1, just before you initialize the EMS. If you have time, and only if you have time, do the EMS entry check. Otherwise, forget it and go right on into EMS initialization. You understand?;CMP
178963.8;CMP;Okay. You're going to delete between 2 hours and 30 minutes and 02:15 there, and you're going to add it, if there is time, only if there is time, at EI minus 1 hour where the EMS initialization occurs.;CAPCOM
178985.8;CAPCOM;That's right. You got it correctly. Okay, Jack. One other item. Just before EI minus 2 hours and 15 minutes, we need an E-memory dump Verb 74 Enter. Over. [Pause.];CMP

And one thing we want to remind you of, when you remove power from the Command Module LM umbilical, is to be sure that you open the LM Power Main B circuit breakers, both of them, before you start throwing switches and circuit breakers in the LM. Do it as we've outlined it in the procedure, in that order. Over.;CMP
179413.6;LMP; Okay. That's the way we planned on it. We'll let Jack do his three and then he'll tell us when we're Go from there. What pages are those changes on? [Pause.];CAPCOM
179428.6;CAPCOM; Okay, Fred. The one I've got for you is at the end of power removal from the Command Module LM umbilical. And just for your information, after you go through that entire procedure and about the time you're ready to transfer to the Command Module, at that time, power will be removed from the umbilical, and it's okay to disconnect it. That is, after you've thrown the switches in the LM. Is that clear?;LMP
179461.6;LMP; Roger. That's where I've got a remark here to check with you to see if it's all right to proceed.;CAPCOM
179468.6;CAPCOM;Roger. And that would be just after, on panel 16, you opening Ascent ECA Control breakers. [Pause.];LMP
179482.6;LMP; Which step number is that? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
179503.6;LMP;The confusing thing is, Jack, where they told me to wait for MSFN Go before proceeding was that Bat 2 Low Volts Off/Reset, then On.;CAPCOM
179512.6;CAPCOM;Okay. That's still affirmative. We'll give you a go after waiting 5 seconds, and then down from there just a few steps, after you have opened the Ascent ECA Control breakers on panel 16, at that point, the umbilical is not powered, and it's okay to disconnect them should you care to do so.;LMP
179535.6;LMP; Okay. After the last step then, I'm free to disconnect.;CAPCOM
179539.6;CAPCOM; Right. And one other change we have is, shortly after that, where we're configuring for jettison, we have closed both the Forward Dump valve and the Overhead Dump valve. And we don't want to get in a locked up position like that, so one way to get around it is to - After we close the Forward Dump valve, turn the Descent Oxygen valve off. Over.;LMP
179577.6;LMP; Okay. After the Forward Dump valve, add a step in that says the Descent Ox valve, off. [Pause.];CAPCOM
179591.6;CAPCOM;Okay, Fred. That concludes the Deltas. And perhaps you heard that our Gammas are still minus 6.03 and our Delta-V will be a 2.8 foot per second RCS burn.;LMP
179606.6;LMP; Roger. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
179643.6;CAPCOM;Freddo, we've got one more change we'd like to give you to clarify a question that Jack asked earlier. At EI minus 02:30 ...;LMP
179655.6;LMP; Okay. Hold on a minute, Jack. I meant to call Jack back down. I'm not familiar with the previous discussion.;CAPCOM
179662.6;CAPCOM; Negative. This is on your checklist.;LMP
179667.6;LMP; Okay. Go ahead.;CAPCOM
179669.6;CAPCOM;"At E mi - EI minus 02:30, during power removal from the umbilical, first thing we do is two steps with the CSM. We open the Main B, the LM Power to Main B circuit breakers, and then there's a third step which says ""Circuit breaker EPS Sensor Signal, Main B, open."" Just delete that step. Over.";LMP
179698.6;LMP; Okay. Delete the third step.;CAPCOM
179778.6;CAPCOM;And, Aquarius, for your information, as far as our water supply is concerned, including our plans for powerup, we have an additional 18 hours of water remaining from this point.;LMP
179801.6;LMP; Okay. Eighteen hours of water remaining from this point, Jack. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
179826.6;CDR;" Hello, Houston; Aquarius.";CAPCOM
179829.6;CAPCOM; Hello, Aquarius. Go ahead.;CDR
179832.6;CDR; Okay, Jack. This is Jim. I just want to make sure that you're filtering the changes to the checklist that come up to make sure that they're absolutely essential. When we learn our procedures, we can only do it one time, and we can't make changes at the last minute. We'd like to do the best, the safest way possible, but unless the changes are really essential, don't bother sending them up.;CAPCOM
179857.6;CAPCOM;Roger. We won't. The chairman of the CPCB is still active, and one thing we're trying to do is to save you all the time we can between EI minus 02:30 and 1 hour.;CDR
179870.6;CDR; That's affirm. That's a real important time.;SC
179874.6;SC;Yes. For your information, Jim, I don't know whether you heard that originally, but that time from 2Â½ to 1 in there has been run about three times, and it's pretty tight, so we've tried to weed out what we could, which isn't much, but I think the other message you might impress on Jack when you get around to aligning that platform, don't try to get it down too neat. It doesn't have to be all that good. Just do a nice quick and dirty one, and that's going to be good enough anyway.;CDR
179903.6;CDR; I concur. I think for reentry we don't have to have a real accurate platform, but I haven't told Jack that.;SC
179910.6;SC;Roger. Hey, Jim, while you're up and things are nice and quiet, let me give you a couple of other things to think about. One specifically. I know none of you are sleeping worth a damn because it's so cold, and you might want to dig out the medical kit there around 01:35 or in that ballpark, and pull out a couple of Dexedrines apiece and try one about then, and another around 01:39 to 01:40.;CDR
179935.6;CDR; Well, I hadn't brought that up. We might - We might consider it.;SC
179937.6;SC; Okay. [Long pause.];CDR
179959.6;SC; Wish we could figure a way to get a hot cup of coffee up to you. It'd probably taste pretty good about now, wouldn't it?;CDR
179966.6;CDR;Yes, it sure would. You don't realize how cold this thing becomes when it's in a PTC mode that's slowing down, and I just clocked the cycles on my [garble] And it's about 11 to 12 minutes now, and the Sun is directly overhead, so it's shining on the engine bell of the Service Module and not getting down to the spacecraft at all. [Pause.];SC
179996.6;CAPCOM; Hang in there. It won't be long now.;CDR
179999.6;CDR; Yes. That's right. As a matter of fact, doing this alignment on the Earth this time will be like making a landing with a fogged-up windshield.;CAPCOM
180012.4;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. [Long pause.];CDR
180025.4;CDR; Go ahead, Houston.;CAPCOM
180027.4;CAPCOM;"Okay, Skipper. We figured out a way for you to keep warm. We decided to start powering you up now, and what we want you to do - what we want you to do is take your entry LM Prep checklist and start at the top where it says ""Bat 5 Normal FEED on,"" and then jump over as it says to your 30-minute activation, and do all of the 30-minute activation up to, but not including, the burn. You copy?";CDR
180071.4;CDR; Okay. If I understand you correctly, then that gives me leeway to maneuver when we get up to activation complete, and we can be in position for the burn, but we will not burn. We don't have a PAD anyway. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
180094.4;CAPCOM; That's affirm, Jim. You could maneuver to burn attitude, or you could maneuver to an attitude which should put the Sun in the windows to warm the place up.;CDR
180102.4;CDR; Sounds good, and you're sure we have plenty of electrical power to do this?;CAPCOM
180108.4;CAPCOM; That's affirmative. We've got plenty of power to do it. I can get you a number, though.;SC
180116.4;SC;Jim, you've got about 100-per cent margins on everything from here on in.;CAPCOM
180124.4;CDR; That sounds encouraging.;SC
180125.4;SC; Roger. That's in the LM. We're not talking about the CSM right now.;CDR
180131.4;CDR; I understand.;LMP
180137.2;LMP; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
180140.2;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;LMP
180144.2;LMP;Okay. Question. This short turn on step 3 on page 24 has us only turning on the RCS System A/B, two quads, and the breakers are still out on panel 11. Did you want those in, too, or are we just going to use one set of heaters?;CAPCOM
180163.2;CAPCOM; Stand by. [Long pause.];LMP
180193.2;CAPCOM;Aquarius, Houston. Go as the checklist recommends for now. When you get into the circuit breaker panel configuration, you're going to get the number 1 set of heaters on anyway.;LMP
180205.2;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
180218.8;LMP; Okay, Houston. We'd like to get a hack to set our mission timer here, Jack. ;CAPCOM
180225.8;CAPCOM;Okay, Freddo. Set it at 133:35 straight up. You've got about 30 seconds to set it. [Long pause.];LMP
180253.8;LMP; Okay. Standing by.;CAPCOM
180256.8;CAPCOM;Okay. I'll give you the 2-second delay in there. Stand by to start.;LMP
180263.8;CAPCOM; Start.;LMP
180267.8;LMP; Okay. We've got it.;CAPCOM
180269.8;CAPCOM;Okay. I'm counting 133:35:10.;LMP
180275.8;LMP; Right on. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
180305.8;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. One other way to warm things up in a hurry in there is when you get your AC on to turn on the window heaters. [Long pause.];LMP
180322.8;LMP; Okay. I guess the only question I have is what it's liable to do to us with the - looks like almost a frost on it now. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
180349.8;LMP; Understand this, Jack. I'd like to let it maybe warm up just a little bit more before hitting it with the heat load.;CAPCOM
180357.8;CAPCOM; Not a bad idea.;LMP
180470.8;LMP;And, as you can see, Houston, at turn-on we got our old friend downlink 2 back. [Pause.];CAPCOM
180481.8;CAPCOM; Roger. We're seeing it, Fred.;LMP
180517.0;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. It looks like you're proceeding toward the gimbal lock there. We'd like you to check that, please. [Pause.];CDR
180529.0;CDR; Roger. Not much we can do about it. We can't use the thrusters, Houston. ;CAPCOM
180541.0;CAPCOM;" Okay. Forget it now; we'll get it later.";CDR
180577.6;LMP;And, Houston, Aquarius. I guess the next thing for the PGNS will be a coarse align 000, but I guess we ought to hold up now until we get enough time on the RCS thrusters.;CAPCOM
180589.6;CAPCOM;Roger. We're looking at them. We'll give you the Go on them. Okay, Aquarius. Your quads are 120 to 133 now, so you're cleared for - Cleared for thrusters.;LMP
180611.2;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;CDR
180615.2;CDR; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
180616.2;CAPCOM; Roger. Did you get my Go for RCS?;CDR
180619.2;CDR; That's affirm. We're Go. What we're doing now, Jack, is letting the spacecraft drift in this mode to pick up the Earth again.;CAPCOM
180623.2;CAPCOM; Okay.;CDR
180630.2;CDR; I don't want to just go blasting around the sky and get high rates, because I don't have anything to null the rates on until the Earth comes back up again. And - Once I get the Earth in sight, we have no strain on nulling rates. That part of the Earth, that is.;CAPCOM
180634.0;CDR;" It's going to be interesting today, Jack. The Earth's a lot bigger; the crescent is a lot more pronounced than it was yesterday. [Pause.]";CAPCOM
180648.0;CAPCOM; Well, you're going in the right direction.;CDR
180654.0;CDR; That's right.;LMP
180731.0;LMP;And, Jack, I guess we haven't changed our angle much with respect to the Sun 93 million miles away, so it ought to be in about the same place in the AOT, isn't that Charlie? [Long pause.];CDR
180754.0;CAPCOM;Hold 1 on that, Fred. I'll get an answer for you.;LMP
180758.0;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
180844.0;CAPCOM; Aquarius, your ASA is warmed up now. You can activate the AGS.;LMP
180850.0;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
180889.2;CAPCOM;Aquarius, Houston. When you look out a detent 2 in the proper burn attitude, what you ought to see is the Sun at 12 o'clock, about halfway between the top of the AOT and the center of the pipper. And you ought to see the Earth...;LMP
180906.2;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
180907.2;CAPCOM;...at 6 o'clock.;LMP
180910.2;LMP; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
180944.2;CDR; And, it's getting a little warmer in here now. Thank you. [Long pause.];SC
180961.2;SC; Duck blinds are always warmer, Jim, when the birds are flying.;CDR
180969.2;CDR; Right. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
181010.2;CDR; Jack, I've gotten so used to flying attitude with the TTCA, I won't be able to do it normally.;CAPCOM
181019.2;CAPCOM; Say again, Jim.;CDR
181022.2;CDR; I said I gotten so used to flying attitude with the translational control, I won't be able to do with the ACA.;CAPCOM
181037.8;CAPCOM; Aquarius, we see your glycol temperature getting up there. If you want to make it a little warmer, or you can try putting your Suit Temp valve to High, if you haven't already got it there. [Pause.];LMP
181056.8;LMP; Okay.;CAPCOM
181074.3;CAPCOM; Aquarius, something we're thinking about right now is, if we can do it without using a lot of RCS, it would be to our advantage timewise to try to get an alignment. [Pause.];CDR
181089.3;CDR;Okay. You mean a P52?;CAPCOM
181094.3;CAPCOM; We're...;CDR
181095.3;CDR; I'll [garble] around.;CAPCOM
181096.3;CAPCOM;A combination of 51 and 52. [Pause.];CDR
181104.3;CDR; I'll see what we can do, Jack.;CAPCOM
181107.3;CAPCOM; Okay. And we'd planned to use the Moon and the Sun for that.;CDR
181110.9;CAPCOM;Aquarius, Houston. On panel 16, we'd like for you to close the Cross Tie Bal Loads breaker, please.;CMP
181121.9;LMP; Okay. it's closed. [Pause.];CAPCOM
181128.9;CAPCOM; And it looks like we could support a - an alignment in a few minutes, if you'd be willing to go ahead with that.;LMP
181137.9;CDR; Jack, it sounds good. I think from our position here, we know where the Sun and Moon are and it's strictly going to be a pitch maneuver. But I think we can save some gas. I'll see what we can do.;CAPCOM
181148.9;CAPCOM; Roger.;CDR
181157.2;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
181159.2;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CDR
181161.2;CDR; We're all set to go. Are you going to ship us up a REFSMMAT?;CAPCOM
181165.2;CAPCOM;Yes, we are. Stand by 1.;CDR
181168.2;CDR; Okay. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
181184.2;CDR; The Sun feels wonderful. It's shining in the rendezvous window. [Pause.];CAPCOM
181191.2;CAPCOM;And, Aquarius, before we can ship you a load, we'll have to have, on panel 11, under Comm, the Updata Link circuit breaker closed.;CDR
181213.2;CDR; It's closed.;CAPCOM
181219.2;CAPCOM; Roger. It'll be a few...;CDR
181220.2;CDR; [Garble] closed [garble].;CAPCOM
181221.2;CAPCOM; Okay. And it'll be a few minutes yet, Jim. We're still cranking it up. [Pause.];LMP
181229.2;LMP; Okay. Stay with it, Jack, and I'll go back to data.;CAPCOM
181234.2;CAPCOM; Roger. [Long pause.];LMP
181281.2;LMP;"I got Bat in about 33&amp;frac13 per cent on that uplink. Too fast alarm. [Pause.]";CAPCOM
181292.2;CAPCOM; Say again on that, Fred.;LMP
181299.2;LMP; I just got another uplink too fast when I took the Data switch back off - It's happening, I guess, about a third of the time.;CAPCOM
181304.2;CAPCOM; Roger.;CDR
181319.2;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. We're ready with your load if you'll give us Data please.;CDR
181324.2;CDR; Going to Data. You got it.;CAPCOM
181332.8;CAPCOM;Aquarius, Houston. After the uplink, you'll have to set the drift and the REFSMMAT flag as on page 8 of the contingency book, steps 5 and 6.;CDR
181345.8;CDR;Page 8, steps 5 and 6. Roger.;LMP
181355.1;LMP; Okay. Are you done with the computer now, Jack?;CDR
181358.1;CAPCOM; Negative. We'll give you the word.;SC
181361.1;SC; Roger. Aquarius, we're through with it, it's your computer.;CAPCOM
181366.1;CDR; Thank you.;CAPCOM
181486.1;CAPCOM;"And, Aquarius, Houston; take option 1 on a P52 when you get to it. And I've got some ball angles for a Sun and Moon.";CDR
181500.1;LMP;Okay. We want an option 1 and you've got some ball angles for Sun and Moon. And right now, Jim has the Sun pretty well squared away right in the middle of AOT.;CAPCOM
181529.1;LMP; And have you got some plan in vectors for us, Jack? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
181547.1;CAPCOM;"Okay, Freddo. For the Sun, I've got 246; for the Moon I've got 250. [Pause.]";LMP
181565.1;LMP; Are you talking about ball theta angles?;CAPCOM
181569.1;CAPCOM;Negative. I was - I was reporting the code for Noun 70.;CT
181577.1;CT; They're in the computer, Fred.;CAPCOM
181580.1;LMP; Oh, Okay.;CDR
181590.3;CDR; Okay, Houston. We have the Sun marks and I'll start up at pitch now to go over and pick up the Moon.;CAPCOM
181598.3;CAPCOM; Roger.;CDR
181604.9;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
181606.9;CAPCOM; Go ahead.;CDR
181609.9;CDR;Just as a note of interest, in this dock configurations for P52s, the Command Module docking probe is right down the middle of - the docking light, rather, is right down the middle of the detent. And when the Sun flashes on, it really makes it difficult.;CAPCOM
181630.9;CAPCOM; Roger.;CDR
181639.0;CDR; Just like the simulator.;CAPCOM
181644.0;CAPCOM; Yes. It was good training. [Long pause.];CDR
181664.0;CDR; Well, Jack, that's what it says the torqueing angles are.;CAPCOM
181668.0;CAPCOM; We haven't got them yet. [Pause.];CDR
181680.0;CAPCOM; Aquarius, hold on to torqueing angles, Please.;CDR
181684.0;CDR; We're doing that. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
181707.0;CAPCOM;" Jim, the reason for the delay is that we're not seeing the data yet. We're having to check a point here; and as soon as they come up, we'll let you know what to do with them.";CDR
181719.0;CDR;Okay. We had a large Noun 05 of - what - 112, and our torqueing angles, Jack, are minus 01713, minus 03278, minus 01395. [Pause.];CAPCOM
181742.0;CAPCOM;Roger. Minus 01713, and we see them now. [Long pause.];CDR
181766.0;CAPCOM; Aquarius, torque them.;CDR
181769.0;CDR; Okay. [Pause.];CAPCOM
181777.0;CDR;At 35:04:25.;CAPCOM
181879.0;CAPCOM; Aquarius, do you have a star close by there you could check? [Pause.];CDR
181887.0;CDR; I'll...I'll look around, Jack. I was just trying to get a check on the Moon, again, to see if those angles were indeed true, and we got the Moon back again and centered.;CAPCOM
181896.0;CAPCOM; Roger.;CDR
181922.0;CDR;Okay, Jack. What you're reading now the angles? We had the Moon centered, and it's pretty close to what we have on the 8 ball, I guess. Close enough for any entry that we'd like to do.;CAPCOM
181933.0;CAPCOM; Roger. And I'm told that Denubla - Denebola and Regulus are nearby if you wanted to make a star check. [Pause.];CDR
181948.0;CDR; Okay. I'm going to start pitching around again, and I'll see if I can pick them up. I have Orion out here to my left a little bit, but it's pretty close to the - oh, here. I've got Sirius. That's a nice one. How about that? [Pause.];CAPCOM
181968.0;CAPCOM; Sounds good here.;CDR
181984.2;CAPCOM; Aquarius, is Jack sitting on the rumble seat there?;LMP
181988.2;LMP; He was. He just headed upstairs to take another look around.;CAPCOM
181993.2;CAPCOM; Okay. I got a minor addition to the entry checklist for him. This time it's in the...;LMP
181998.2;LMP; Okay. Stand...;CAPCOM
182000.2;CAPCOM; ...entry book.;LMP
182002.2;LMP;Okay. Stand by 1. He has that in his pocket. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
182054.2;CDR; What I'm doing, Jack, is just - I'm pitching over now. I'm going to pick up another star. Sirius was just too far off. I thought I was going to use too much gas getting there.;CAPCOM
182065.2;CAPCOM; Roger.;CDR
182068.2;CDR; By the time I get aligned in the - in the AOT - be nice if we didn't, have Odyssey attached, we could just Auto - Auto maneuver over to these things. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
182088.2;CAPCOM; Looks to us like you've got her aligned, Jim, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.;CDR
182093.2;CDR; Yeah. I'm pretty confident that the platform's fairly decent.;CAPCOM
182158.2;CAPCOM;Aquarius, Houston. We need an E Mod Verb 74, when you've got a chance, please.;CDR
182163.2;CDR; Okay. Coming to you.;CMP
182182.8;CMP; Okay, Jack. Go ahead.;CDR
182194.8;CAPCOM;Okay, Jack. On your entry checklist, on page 2-5. Down there on step 9, where it says 152 degrees pitch at .05g, adjacent to that, so that Recovery can see you better on the way down, we want you to turn your S-Band, Power Amplifier to High. Over. [Long pause.];CMP
182244.8;CMP;Okay. Turn S-Band, Power AMP to High at .05g time.;CAPCOM
182256.8;CAPCOM; That's affirmative. [Pause.];CMP
182268.8;CMP; Okay. Is that it?;CAPCOM
182271.8;CAPCOM; That's it, Jack.;CMP
182289.6;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. We're considering doing the midcourse with PGNS, unless you'd rather do it in AGS.;CDR
182299.6;CDR; No. PGNS is fine with me. I just align myself up with the old ball again. So I've got you foresighted again, but any way you want to do it.;CAPCOM
182309.6;CAPCOM; Like you say, you might as well go first class.;CDR
182314.6;CDR; I guess you're right. [Pause.];LMP
182321.6;LMP; Now wait a minute, Jack. [Pause.];CDR
182329.6;CAPCOM; I just lost a lot of friends there.;LMP
182337.6;LMP;And, Jack, you can tell Owen Morris that the RCS System A/B 2 Quad 1 breaker is still nicely in.;CAPCOM
182369.6;CAPCOM; Roger. We'll pass the word.;LMP
182518.6;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. We think we've figured out a way to save you some time at a very critical - very full schedule. And that's by doing a docked coarse align, since we got the LM up now. That would save you a maneuver or two.;CDR
182595.6;CDR; Houston, Aquarius. It seemed to me a docked coarse align might be quicker for - for Jack.;CAPCOM
182602.6;CAPCOM; Yes. We think it would be, and it'd save quite a bit of time at a place where you're going to be pretty busy. Also save you some petrol.;CDR
182613.6;CMP; Affirm. [Long pause.];CAPCOM
182630.6;CAPCOM;Okay, Jim. We're looking at doing this in the Service Module Sep attitude, and the optics will be pointed away from the Sun. So it should be a good attitude for a P52. [Pause.];CMP
182651.6;CDR; Okay. So, we'll be going to the Service Module Sep attitude, at which time we'll do a docked coarse align, and... [Pause.];CAPCOM
182671.6;CDR;Then you want - You want Jack then to do a P52? [Long pause.];CAPCOM
182697.6;CAPCOM;The way we'll do that in our time line Jim, is to go ahead and do the Service Module Jett and then we'll just stay in that attitude and when it comes time in our time line as we've outlined, to bring the platform up, we'll proceed with the P52 - coarse align, and then the P52.;CDR
182717.6;CDR;Okay. Are we going to use the same techniques that we normally do for LM activation? In other words, I try to maintain an attitude, and give him some angles and then - Are you going to give him the angles? Then he does the 52.;CAPCOM
182734.6;CAPCOM; Basically, it's the same procedure just reversed, Jim.;CDR
182738.6;CDR; Okay.;CAPCOM
182739.6;CAPCOM; Another nice thing about this, is it's one we've done before. [Long pause.];CMP

182829.6;CAPCOM;" Roger, Jack. Since we've got the PGNS up, we plan to use that information to give the CMC a dock coarse align, and then we're in the Service Module jettison attitude, we'll wait until it comes time to power up the CMC, and we'll get the CMC a dock coarse align, and we'll pick some good stars to give you a fine align with, and it looks like we can pick some stars that are looking away from the Sun in which you can find in that Service Module jettison attitude; so, we'll save you quite a bit of gas, and save you some time in a very busy time.";CMP

182988.6;CMP;Okay, Jack. It looks - Just looking over what I may expect here, it looks like I'm just going to get three angles to do a Verb 41 Noun 20, right? [Pause.];SC
183004.6;CAPCOM; That's what it looks like from here, Jack. It's pretty much the opposite of the LM activation procedure where we do the dock coarse align.;CMP
183024.6;CMP;Yes, except in a way we did a lot of Verb 06 Noun 20, Enters, simultaneously, and then you all shipped him up post-torque values. You're not going to do anything like that are you? [Pause.];CAPCOM
183039.6;CAPCOM; Say again, please, Jack.;CMP
183042.6;CMP;Okay. During the activation part, we do a lot of Verb 06 Noun 20, Enters simultaneously, reading you out the difference in the angles, and then MSFN furnishes the post-torqueing angles, in order to get the platform fine aligned. Do you plan something like that or just three coarse align angles. [Pause.];CAPCOM
183072.6;CAPCOM;Jack, we're going to give you three coarse align angles, and then you can go right to your checklist as we're giving it, and start in with the Verb 40 Noun 20.;CMP

189738.9;CDR;Yes. I'll try to hold the attitude we select directly, while you're giving us the coarse align attitude. We're not too sure what - what's the best attitude. I'm going to ask Jack again if 115 is sufficient for him.;CAPCOM
189754.9;CAPCOM; Okay. You can take some time figuring out the best attitude, and then you won't have to hold it all the way from now until then, if you just get back to it.;CDR
189870.9;CDR;Houston, Jack would like to know what constellations are in his sextant, or scanning telescope, field of view at an attitude of about 105 pitch, zero roll, zero yaw. Can you give that to us?;CAPCOM
189887.9;CAPCOM;Okay. We'll sure give it a go. As I said, we - We have some stars. They're not - They're not centered with the shaft and trunnion zero. Let us take a quick look at 105 pitch, shaft and trunnion zero, and see if we can get you an answer. [Long pause.];CDR
189924.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;CDR
189927.9;CDR; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
189928.9;CAPCOM;Roger. These - None of these stars will be exactly centered, but, at a pitch attitude of 115, we had computed that Vega, Altair, Rasalhague, and Deneb would all be in the telescope field of view, and the first three were also in view at the 91-degree pitch, so he should be able to see one or more of those four stars. Over.;CDR
189962.9;CDR; Okay. Thank you, very much.;CAPCOM
189965.9;CAPCOM; Okay. And, Jim, I can give shaft and trunnions if - if he's interested.;CDR
189974.9;CDR;Okay. Why don't you give us the shaft and trunion for - say, Altair at 115, and I'll go up there, and I'll see if he can pick it up.;CAPCOM
189984.9;CAPCOM;Okay. Real fine, At 115 degrees of pitch, Altair, shaft 274, trunnion 22.2. Over.;CDR

190099.9;CAPCOM;"Okay, Aquarius; Houston. With the present amount of power you've got in the LM, which is over 500 amp-hours, and the rate you're using them, we figure you've got almost 12 hours of power left.";CDR

190163.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston. Go.;CDR
190168.9;CDR; I ran back there to take a look and see what I could see in the - in the scanning telescope. It looks pretty grim back there right now. It might be that we have to go with the coarse align, and maybe computation of some fine align docking angles, if we have time.;CAPCOM
190184.9;CAPCOM;" Okay. We'd like to do that, too. Wait a minute; stand by, Jim.";CDR
190286.9;SC; Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?;CAPCOM
190289.9;CDR; I read you loud and clear.;SC
190290.9;SC;"Okay. What we'd like to do, Jim, is - We'll go ahead and get the coarse align to the gimbal angles that - that you're going to be holding for us; and we'll get the platform up, and then when you call P52 and you use PICAPAR, it probably won't be close enough to put the star in the sextant, but if you can see any kind of a bright star in the general vicinity, - and like general vicinity, I mean 2 to 3 degrees from the center of the telescope, so that you have some clue as to which way to go, then the identification problem shouldn't present much of a - of a difficulty. And once you get the thing in the sextant, then you can go ahead and treat it like any other PICAPAR.";CDR
190336.9;CDR;" That sounds great, Ken. One little problem: there's all sorts of bright objects floating around us, and also that just staring at part of Aquarius; it's just reflecting light like mad. We can give it a try. There's no problem there; if we can see it, we'll get it.";SC
190356.9;SC;" Okay. And in - in the event that that doesn't work, we're standing by with the original scheme, a set of LM FDAI angles to fly to that'll point the Command Module optics at the Moon and the Sun; so we can always go back to that.";CDR

190421.3;CDR;We'll go with your original 91-degree angle, if you have the stars figured out, and the coarse align angle for it.;CAPCOM
190430.3;CAPCOM;Okay. Roger that, Jim. Then at - at your convenience here, we'd like you to go to that attitude, as close as you can get, and call up a Noun 20 for us.;CDR

190445.3;CAPCOM; Okay.;CDR
190450.9;CDR; Houston, Aquarius.;CAPCOM
190454.9;CAPCOM; Go ahead, Aquarius.;CDR
190457.9;CDR; Okay. I take it that, if - if Jack cannot see stars at this attitude after you give him the coarse align angles, we're just not going to read down to you our gimbal angles and have you figure out a target angle for Jack, but you want him to do sighting on the Moon and the Sun. Is that correct?;CAPCOM
190478.9;CAPCOM;That's roughly correct, Jim. Jack will coarse align at that attitude. This is what we're having you maneuver to the - to that attitude for. We're going to compute coarse align gimbal angles and pass them up to him, and the first thing he'll do when he gets there, per his checklist, is to coarse align his platform. Then he'll go into the P52, and, if he can't see stars, we will quickly pass up to you the - your FDAI angles to put him in the Moon-view attitude, and he'll do his P52 on the Moon, and then have you maneuver on the Sun and complete the P52 of the Sun.;CDR
190523.9;CDR; Okay. But I'm going to have to maneuver to the Moon to help him out.;CAPCOM
190527.9;CAPCOM; Oh. That's - That's affirmative. If he can't see stars at the - at the Sep attitude that - that you'll be holding, you'll have to maneuver to the Moon attitude and then to the Sun attitude for him.;CDR
190598.9;CAPCOM; Aquarius, Houston.;CDR
190601.9;CDR; Go ahead.;CAPCOM
190602.9;CAPCOM;Just like to mention that, even if, for some reason, we run out of time or something and don't complete the Moon-Sun P52, Jack will have a platform coarse align to the entry REFSMMAT, which we feel will be plenty good enough.;CDR

We're getting about 9 minutes from the commencement of Command Module power-up, and we wanted to just mention to you for Jack's benefit that, although the batteries are looking real good, in case they're cool and have a little difficulty hacking the load just at first, we'd like him to monitor main bus voltage to 24 volts or above during the power-up procedure and, if it falls below, we'll have a couple of circuit breakers for him that - that will solve the problem.
